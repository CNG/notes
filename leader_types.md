# Types of leaders

* **seers**: individuals who are living in the future, who possess a compelling
  vision of “what could be.” As human beings, we’re constantly looking forward,
  and we love to sign on with individuals who are already working on “the next
  big thing.”
* **contrarians**: free of the shackles of conventional wisdom and eager to
  help others stage a jailbreak. It’s exciting to be around these free-spirited
  thinkers who liberate us from the status quo and open our minds to new
  possibilities.
* **architects**: adept at building systems that elicit contribution and
  facilitate collaboration. They leverage social technologies in ways that
  amplify dissident voices, coalesce communities of passion and unleash the
  forces of change.
* **mentors**: rather than hoarding power, they give it away. Like Mary Parker
  Follett, the early 20th-century management pioneer, they believe the primary
  job of a leader is to create more leaders. To this end, they coach, tutor,
  challenge and encourage.
* **connectors**: with a gift for spotting the “combinational chemistry”
  between ideas and individuals. They help others achieve their dreams by
  connecting them with sponsors, like-minded peers, and complementary resources.
* **bushwhackers**: they clear the trail for new ideas and initiatives by
  chopping away at the undergrowth of bureaucracy. They’re more committed to
  doing the right thing than to doing things right.
* **guardians**: vigilant defenders of core values and enemies of expediency.
  Their unflinching commitment to a higher purpose inspires others and
  encourages them to stand tall for their beliefs.
* **citizens**: true activists, their courage to challenge the status quo comes
  from their abiding commitment to doing as much good as possible for as many as
  possible. They are other-centered, not self-centered.
