# Chapter 4: the gene genie

## Summary
Darwin wrote "On the origin of species" to destroy support for slavery and oppression by highlighting our communality and showing a rich variety of life could arise from a common origin, and humans were no different. In the 150 years since the abolition of slavery, blacks still suffer due to a stubborn force that persists through increased income and better diets. This was presumed to be genetic, but we now know identical DNA can cause different organisms because genes can be turned on or off by environmental factors, and those changes can last generations. Effects of epigenetics can have hundreds of thousands of times the impact of random mutation. Understanding epigenetics may allow us to mitigate effects it has on the poor, etc., and complete Darwin's dream for a better, more equitable world.

## Background
* epigenetics (*epi*: over, in addition to)
* Gregor Mendel: law of segregation (only one factor is passed on), inheritance law (each factor independent)
    * In 1894 William Bateson of Cambridge published book of observations of natural variation, and soon after, found Mendel already did this work, so he translated Mendel's to English and coined "genetics" from Greek for "giving birth".
* Our genome has four molecule types rep by A, T, C and G. "words" are 3 letters long, grouped in paragraphs known as exons. Paragraphs lump to make genes, assembled on long strands of sugar and phosphate molecules with ATCG running sideways off strands.

## Malnutrition during human pregnancy

### Negative effects on child's health
* CVD related disease more common in adults with below average birth weight.
    * low birth weight => shortened life expectancy
    * Deprived fetus allocates resources differently, grows slower, smaller kidneys, etc.
    * Damage is permanent. Studies showed "catch up" diet after birth doesn't prevent child's risk of all issues associated with low birth weight.
* *Example:* African Americans have age adjusted all cause mortality rate 1.5x that of whites, heavily due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and precursor conditions (hypertension, diabetes, obesity). Heart disease risk death 1.3x higher and diabetes risk 1.8x higher.

### Effects last multiple generations
* Breast cancer, coronary heart disease increase.
* If mother malnourished early in pregnancy, obesity more likely and double schizophrenia risk.
* If mother malnourished late in pregnancy (when baby grows most), low birth weight, smaller for life, reduced obesity likelihood.
* These effects last multiple generations despite unchanged genome.
* *Source*: Researchers in early 1990s looked at ancestors of those under German occupation in 1944, the Dutch Hunger Winter, which killed 22,000 due to systematic starvation for refusing to fight allies. Found at least two generations of effects (on the baby that suffered in the womb, and the baby's children).

## Diet in pregnancy affects mice for generations
* Methyl donor is food that allows methyl group (carbon + 3 hydrogen) to easily detach. Examples: onions, beets, soy milk, folic acid.
* Methyl groups attach to DNA and regular gene expression.
* Hair color in humans genetic. (Redhead caused by single gene, MC1R.)
* Hair color in Agouti mice determined by epigenetics.
* Diet rich in methyl donors turns off agouti gene needed to produce the yellow fur the mother had, resulting in brown fur babies.
* Some methylation survives two "purges" (in gamete formation and another of the chromosomes).
* Result: Methylation from diet of mother can affect her offspring's offspring, and onward.
* Agouti gene also determines health outcomes: Yellow mice tend to be fatter, with increased appetite and proclivity to cancer and diabetes.

## Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans
### Neural tube defects and methylation
#### Background
* Yellapragada Subbarao discovered cure for tropical sprue, disease results from imbalance of gut bacteria causing inability to absorb nutrients properly.
* Cure is tetracycline, folic acid and Vitamin B12.
* He helped discover first tetracycline "broad spectrum" antibiotic and was first to isolate folic acid.
* He also created aminopterin (first anticancer drug) and discovered ATP.
* His work on folic acid led to cure of neural tube defects.
#### Folic acid methylates genes to close neural tube
* Neural tube encloses spinal cord and brain.
* Folic acid deficiency prevents tube closing, resulting in exposed nerves, spina bifida and anencephaly.
* Folic acid donates methyl group that binds to fetal DNA and ensures gene activation.
* Folic acid supplementation prevented 70â€“80% defects.
* First 4 weeks of pregnancy crucial to neural tube formation.
* 60 countries (not U.K.) now mandate flour and cereals enhanced with folic acid.

## Acceptance of epigenetics

### History of rejection of related ideas
* **Jean Baptiste Lemarck**
    * Theorized biological evolution based on law but acknowledged by no one during his lifetime.
    * **inheritance of acquired traits** and **evolutionary progress** (organisms gradually become more complex over time)
* **Conrad Waddington**
    * Coined "epigenetics" and conceived of "epigenetic landscape" that results in gene expression changing based on chemical environment at a particular point in development.
    * Reinvigorated old (and hated) idea of passing on acquired traits (such as ostriches being born with calluses or fruit fly wing vein patterns changed by temperature in pupation, with the change lasting generations).

### Growing evidence 
* Douglas Ruden in 2003 led to view as passing on of acquired characteristics (a Lamarckian concept) that are still generated at random with respect to needs of organism (a Darwinian concept).
* Megan Hitchins in 2007 found colorectal cancer patient who had a DNA mismatch repair gene deactivated by a methylation that probably was passed from a parent.
* Karin Buiting in 2003 found Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome caused by silenced genes methylated in grandparents' generation or earlier.
* People living near industrial plants in Thailand had DNA much more methylated.
* Blood DNA methylation by airborne pollution, particularly small particulates, alters blood clotting.
* Air pollution results in methylation of genes responsible for nitric oxide production, a cause of asthma and wheezing in children.
* Japanese study showed environmental stresses can cause DNA to unfold, exposing to activation or silencing by nearby molecules, and unraveled DNA passed on to next generations.
* 2013, Cambridge researchers showed 1% epigenetic changes make it into sperm and eggs.
* Swedish records of births, deaths and causes, and famines allowed long term nutritional study. Found boy who overate in a glut year would reduce grandson's life expectancy by 32 years.
* Study showed boy who smokes before age 11 will have sons significantly more overweight by age 9. This could only happen if smoking puts some epigenetic marker on sperm, which is starting to be produced around age 11. 

### Mechanism
* Chromatin is mass of DNA and surrounding proteins in cell nucleus.
* Histones proteins wrap DNA and contain sites where other molecules can bind. 
* Can be supplemented by methyl, phosphate, acetyl groups or other proteins totaling more than 50 combinations that change expression.
* Resulting shape of DNA and histone complex determines which genes are accessible for transcription.
* Epigenetic changes caused by diet, temperature and environmental factors like pollution.

### Monumental consequences
* Darwin thought spontaneous mutations happen at random and were only source of variation in organism.
* 2011, Salk Institute in La Joya, Calif., showed epigenetic changes have 100,000s of times more influence than spontaneous mutations.
    * Methyl groups can influence thousands of genes.
    * Occur in hot spots on the genome, usually sites where they induce significant change to protein production.
    * Changes last at least 30 generations.
