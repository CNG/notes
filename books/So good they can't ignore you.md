Summary of rule 4: To construct work you love, you must first build career capital and cash in this capital for the type of traits that define compelling careers. Mission is one of these traits. In the first chapter of this rule, I reinforced the idea that this trait, like all desirable career traits, really does require career capital. You can't skip straight into a great mission without first building mastery in your field. Drawing from the terminology of Steven Johnson, I argued that the best ideas for missions are found in the adjacent possible, the region just beyond the current cutting edge. To encounter these ideas therefore you must first get to that cutting edge, which in turn requires expertise. To try to devise a mission when you're new to a field and lacking any career capital is a venture bound for failure. Once you identify a general mission, you're still left with the task of launching specific projects that make it succeed. little bets => feedback => figure out what to try next. systematic exploration can uncover exceptional way forward you might not have noticed. little bets also leads to marketing mindset, "law of remark ability": for project to transform mission into a success, must first 1) compels people to remark about it 2) launched in venue where people can remark about it.



Working right trumps finding the right work. (through 4 rules)
