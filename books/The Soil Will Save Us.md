# The soil will save us: how scientists, farmers, and foodies are healing the soil to save the planet
Kristin Ohlson, 2014

# Introduction

Ohlson described her history of lawn woes, largely due to apathy, before a change in 2011. Many solutions involved chemicals, but she settled on a recommendation of aeration, compost and reseeding. She didn't have enough compost, but covered the lawn with fallen leaves instead of disposing of them.

Cleveland restauranteur Parker Bosley sought local ingredients since late 1980s and influenced farmers to sell directly and improve quality all around. He alerted Ohlson to "carbon farming" or "soil farming" or "microbe farming", practice taking hold among small farmers. Even the 70% (American Farm Bureau) who don't believe in global warming still took part due to benefits to lands, crops and animals.
# Chapter 1: Where Did All the Carbon Go?

Humans began farming more than 10,000 years ago and were plowing by 2500 BCE. By the 1980s, scientists and the U.S. government have recognized a connection between loss of carbon in farmed soils and greenhouse gases that apparently cause global climate change. Studies found cultivated lands worldwide have lost 80% or more of soil carbon, largely due to tilling, removal of plant waste, overgrazing due to captive herds and use of chemicals, all of which destroys the soil microbiome. Soil scientists and visionary (mostly small and educated) farmers are finding ways to reverse the trend, often by taking cues from nature:  no tilling, no chemicals, herds of free range animals, scattering plant waste on the fields. Benefits include better water absorption, drought tolerance, healthier plants and animals and carbon sequestration. Changing farming practices worldwide might reverse the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policymakers are taking note but have not much followed through, but the growth of small farmers and interested groups is a promising trend.
* Farmer Abe Collins transformed his land using Rattan Lal and others' ideas and became soil carbon evangelist* Rattan Lal, director of Ohio State University's Carbon Management and Sequestration Center (C-MASC) speaks around world about connection between soil carbon and global warming.
    * Plot 87 of the Waterman Agricultural and Natural Resources Laboratory
    * Book: The Potential of US Cropland to Sequester Carbon and Mitigate the Greenhouse Effect
    * no till agriculture: plowing damages soil structure and exposes soil carbon to oxygen, causing it to float off as CO2
    * recycle crop residue by chopping up and spreading on soil, reducing erosion, regulating temperature, feeding organisms that aerate and enrich soil, making it porous and absorbent
* Lal worked in Africa 13 years researching ways to help local farmers, who practiced slash and burn techniques, resulting in fields lasting only a few years and diminishing forest remaining.
* Broadened perspective when visited in 1982 by Roger Revelle, oceanographer who was among first to connect rising greenhouse gases with climate change.
* By 1987, USDA and the EPA started monitoring; Lal and others formed soil carbon working group to quantify loss and determine recovery prospects.
* Farming started up to 13,000 years ago, with simple tools by 5000 BCE and animal driven plows by 2500BCE.
    * Nature hasn't evolved to account for repeated soil perturbations!
    * Modern farming even worse because heavy machinery compacts soil, requiring even deeper plowing.
    * Before humans, herds of roaming animals grazed on plants and left manure, never staying in one place long due to predators. Now, without fear of predators, animals in small fenced areas eat plants to ground and even pull out roots.
    * This stops plant photosynthesis from storing carbon in soil as humus, long lasting carbon molecule networks, which fertilizes and gives airy texture.
* Lal led studies calculating Ohio lost 50% soil carbon in last 200 years, and in areas of world with longer cultivation history, 80% or more.
* **Prospects to fix**
    * While many clean energy projects aim to reduce emissions, none will reduce existing CO2 without great expense.
    * "The greatest opportunities are in the parts of the world where carbon has been most depleted by thousands of years of farming, in sub-Saharan Africa, south and central Asia, and Central America."
    * Lal thinks 3 billion tons of carbon can be sequestered annually in world's soils, reducing CO2 by 3ppm yearly; others  more optimistic, esp outside academia
    * Lal spoke to Congress six times, seven intl conferences in 2011 alone addressed soil/climate, but not much followthrough: “I tell them about 25-year sustainability plans, but they only have a four-year span of attention.”* **agrarian renaissance due to demand for sustainably raised foods**
    * number of small farmers (often college educated) in the U.S. growing for first time since Great Depression
    * reducing or eliminating fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, hormones, antibiotics, etc., letting animals graze on grass instead of forcing unnatural diets => soil gets blacker, richer with carbon
    * new farmers becoming citizen scientists and entrepreneurs looking to get paid for carbon crop
    * environmental community leery of softening emissions reduction pressure on energy and industry sectors
# Chapter 2: The Marriage of Light and Dark
Plants and myriad soil organisms have a long evolutionary history of interdependence that we are only just starting to understand. In addition to producing healthier plants, healthy soils provide drought protection, flood prevention, purification of water and carbon sequestration. With greenhouse gases skyrocketing as they are, soil based carbon sequestration may be the only viable option to reverse global climate change.* Original “polluters” were cyanobacteria—blue-green photosynthetic, aquatic bacteria that gave rise to plants—which began to change the balance of gases in our atmosphere some 2.9 BYA when planet was around 1.6 BYO.
    * Probably first were archaea (“ancient”) that live deep in the ocean near volcanic vents.    * Bacteria evolved 3.5 BYA and lived in ocean (not enough oxygen in atmosphere to protect from sun’s killer ultraviolet light).
    * First photoautotrophs were purple bacteria that captured light with pigment similar to the heme pigment in blood. Electrons from sulfur powered the conversion of solar energy into cellular energy.
    * After cyanobacteria got electrons from water (liberating oxygen), they could now spread further. Earth’s atmosphere was ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and methane, with a mere 2 percent oxygen; cyanobacteria cranked it up to 21 percent.
    * An alga swallowed a cyanobacterium 1.6 BYA; photosynthetic algae used green chlorophylls to absorb light from highly energetic blue and red wavelengths.
    * Ample energy led to multicellular organisms.
    * Plants and cyanobacteria require carbon dioxide to produce sugars; every cell in a plant contains chlorophyll and thus carries on photosynthesis.
* Mutually beneficial relationships cycling nutrients formed.
    * Bacteria and cyanobacteria broke down rock to minerals, fungi recycled organic waste.
    * Plants evolved to use "soil food web", produce root exudates and leak up to 40% of their carbon sugars .
    * Microorganisms exchange by solubilizing nutrients (from sand, silt and clay) needed to build mass and create enzymes for biological activity.
    * Teaspoonful of healthy soil contains 1–7 billion organisms, as many as 75,000 species of bacteria, 25,000 species of fungi, 1,000 species of protozoa, and 100 species of nematodes.
    * Later came mycorrhizae ("fungi"+"roots") that connected root systems of many plants, exchanging sugar for nutrients, enabling grasses to evolve to shrubs and trees.* Microorganisms first discovered 1600s; not recognized as beneficial till late 1800s when soil scientists found fungal hyphae everywhere with healthy plants but not in human disturbed areas.
* Further descriptions carried out, but little studying function, possibly due to lack of funding and difficulty. Microorganisms in the soil are part of a complex system and can’t really be understood in isolation. Some 99 percent of soil organisms can’t be grown in a lab for study.* First understanding in 1980s when biologist Dave Coleman urged his Natural Resource Ecology Lab (NREL) at Colorado State University to start trying to figure it out.
* Hired microbiologist Elaine Ingham to investigate complex roles and relationships among the soil biology.
    * Five groups of microorganisms: fungi, bacteria, mobile one-celled organisms called protozoa, tiny worms called nematodes, and microarthropods, which are related to crustaceans and insects.
    * Visible organisms: earthworms, beetles, voles, etc.
* NREL learned virtually all plants rely on soil microbes intertwined with roots that can extend 200 feet down; even some grasses have 15 foot roots, and microbes have been found as far as 10 miles down in soil.
* Learning of more and more nutrients plants need, and they get all from soil or air with help of microorganisms.
    * Fungi deposit some directly inside root cells.
    * Others such as cobalt and sulfur must be swallowed by bacteria swallowed by protozoa or nematodes or microarthropods and then excreted near root.
    * Carbon comes from the air without help.
    * Bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to form usable by legume plants, which then die and disperse the nitrogen to other plants through the soil.* Mycorrhizal fungi work with many plants and can shoot out their hyphae 250 yards connecting many different plants.* Bacteria more particular; some evolved to eat a particular kind of carbon sugar and will only cluster around a few kinds of plants. Could explain difficulty in restoring degraded habitats.* Bacteria also can be specialized for conditions like temperature and moisture level; some species may be present but not productive till conditions are right.
* Soil aggregates form by bacteria glueing themselves to silt with carbon glue formed from the sugars, forming structure with space for water and gases, which bacteria need to breathe. Then fungi bundle their reproductive parts inside a shall of these structures for protection from predatory microarthropods.
* Clay is tiny rods that line up and prevent water flow, while sand is large particles that can't hold water. In both cases, soil aggregates solve the problem by either jumbling the rods or forming tiny dams among the large grains.* Greenhouse gases     * Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier noted in the early 1800s suggested that our atmosphere provides an insulating blanket which keeps us warm.
    * Later that century, John Tyndall showed atmospheric gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide could absorb and emit enough radiant heat to control the planet’s temperature.
    * In 1896 Svante Arrhenius showed changing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide might explain earth’s cycle of ice ages and temperate periods, and noted that humans might have an influence on this concentration through the burning of coal.
    * In 1938 Guy Stewart Callendar pointed out the links among fossil fuel combustion, rising CO2 levels, and rises in world temperature.
    * In 1959 Bert Bolin and Erik Eriksson showed only some CO2 was absorbed by the ocean, but most drifted back into the atmosphere.
    * In 1958 Harry Wexler of U.S. Weather Bureau secured funding for a permanent station at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii to monitor the gas and tapped a young research chemist named Charles Keeling, who discovered an accurate way to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide and pegged it at 310 parts per million. 
    * In 2005 was 380 ppm; by 2013 was 400 ppm. Stopping all fossil fuel use now would still leave legacy load that'd take thousands of years to dissipate.
    * Handful of scientists and entrepreneurs have plans to remove this legacy load but so far the ideas either have frightening caveats attached or are prohibitively expensive.
* The soil carbon cycle results in longer and longer chains of thousands of carbon atoms, making soil darker.
* Soil chemists called carbon chain compounds "organic" for hundreds of years. Jerome Irving Rodale used term in 1940s for nutritious food produced by agriculture that worked with nature.
* Only 1 to 10 percent of carbon entering soil gets locked away as humin, which can last centuries. (Kristine Nichols, a soil microbiologist with the USDA’s Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory in North Dakota)

# Chapter 3: Send In the Cows
Human activity over thousands of years has caused biodiversity loss, desertification, and climate change. Allan Savory and others are evangelizing the idea modern land management practices like reducing herds and burning grasses are making the problems worse, and holistic management can reverse the damage. This involves herding larger numbers of animals to trample grasses into the soil and adapting treatment based on results. Scientists don't all accept his methods, but they are difficult to study under the reductionist system. Still, HM is catching on among 10,000+ ranchers impressed by the results of HM and frustrated by failures of established practices.

* Allan Savory (born 1936 Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe) with wife Jody Butterfield wrote book "Holistic Management: A New Framework for Decision Making".
* We long assumed the land was degrading because too many cattle were also grazing the savannas.
* Humans have long been hard on the environment; before 200 years ago, people actually had larger average footprint than now, per person. 75 percent total global deforestation occurred before 1850.
* Populations exploded and deforestation became rampant in Europe and China about 8,000 years ago, releasing carbon through burning forests and degraded soils and also methane from wetlands, irrigated rice fields, and livestock.
* Early humans created huge deserts in areas where humans have lived the longest, including the Sahara and the Tihama in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
* Modern land management's burning of grasses only intensified problem.
* After observing many cases of animal removal not halting degradation, Savory thought land might have passed a point of no return. Then saw Scottish lands get harshly overgrazed but then healed when rested.
* Started going barefoot in 1960s civil war where he served as a tracker combat unit and honed his skills reading the land. Savory realized that animals in their natural state had a positive effect on brittle landscapes.
* Realized animals that stayed in close herds for protection trampled into the soil grasses that would otherwise oxidize, weather and block sunlight for seedlings.
* Savory doesn’t claim that he was the first to notice the connection between large numbers of herding animals and soil health—folk wisdom from various countries held that animals could improve the land with their hooves.
* Domestic cattle graze their favorite grass type to the ground till roots die, then move on to next. People assumed this was natural.
* Savory went to South Africa to see how farmer John Acocks kept his cattle in small areas for short amounts of time to prevent overgrazing.
* French scientist André Voisin explained in "Grass Productivity" 60 years earlier overgrazing was determined not by the number of animals on a plot of land, but on how long they stayed there.
* “When you graze and then let the plants recover, they pulse carbon and moisture into the soil,” Savory explained. “Trees don’t do the same thing. That’s why grasslands are so important to carbon cycling.”
* By the mid-1960s, Savory flipped his political alliances; instead of tracking black guerillas, he was now the leading voice of white opposition in parliament to the racist Ian Smith government. His interest in politics had stemmed initially from his conviction that environmentalists needed to get into politics. But just as he didn’t believe in separating the science of plants from the science of animals, he couldn’t separate what was happening on the land from the fate of people who lived on the land. “I wore many hats at that time,” Savory told me. “But whatever hat I was wearing, I was always interested in poor land leading to the loss of wildlife, to poverty and violence, to the abuse of women and children, to political upheaval. In my mind, it was always the same thing.”
* Savory became an independent researcher, consultant and rancher after becoming frustrated when he couldn't publish in peer reviewed journals and couldn't convince range managers to change everything they believed.
* Savory’s definition of desertification was becoming more nuanced, measured space between grass plants and roots sticking in air due to soil erosion.
* "…developed an approach for healing the land that is now known as holistic planned grazing. It departs from all other land management strategies in that the process begins by asking farmers and ranchers to describe the lives they want to lead based on their deepest cultural, spiritual, and material values and to identify ways of working on the land that would support these lives for thousands of years."
* Savory first encountered this kind of holistic framework when he studied the work of Jan Smuts, a South African lawyer, botanist, soldier, and two-time prime minister of South Africa. Later praised by Albert Einstein as having ideated the other of the two concepts—including his own theory of relativity—that would be important to the future of humanity, Smuts believed that nature functions in wholes and patterns, that it is a complicated system that humans erroneously approach as a complex machine. When we interact with nature mechanistically and assume we need only remove or change one cog to fix a problem, we are bound to incur unintended consequences that are often worse than the problem.
* Our ignorance about the holistic nature of our environment is best expressed by the way we approach our most pressing environmental problems. “**The three great issues of the day are biodiversity loss, desertification, and climate change**,” he said. “Each is being addressed separately by different institutions and even within such institutions—universities, environmental organizations, governments and international agencies, and in separate international conferences. Yet **they are one and the same inseparable issue**.”
* Savory rankles many in mainstream and academic science, and others are more accepting, but still feel that Savory’s methods have not been adequately proved by well-controlled studies.
    * In November 2012, a group called Managing Change Northwest invited Savory to speak to the Washington Cattlemen’s Association, the Tilth Producers of Washington, and the Seattle public. Chad Kruger, director of Washington State University’s Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources (CSANR), helped organize the event, then posted his reflections about Savory online. He noted that some critics have concluded that the science supporting Savory’s approach “is either anecdotal or statistically inconclusive because the experiments were poorly designed (they didn’t isolate single variables for analysis). . . . While I don’t think that critiques are necessarily a definite dismissal of the legitimacy of HM [Savory’s holistic management system], I do think they raise an extremely valid question . . . ‘Where’s the data?’ ”
    * Savory's methods don't lend well to reductionist study because they involve changing practices in response to conditions and results, and also they take 5 years or longer, beyond the funding scope of most scientific experiments.
    * Still, now 10,000 ranchers doing holistic management and growing.

# Chapter 4: Letting Nature Do Its Job

* Jay Fuhrer USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service conservationist for Burleigh County demonstrated good soil of Mike and Becky Small’s cornfields by vigorously shaking cornstalk roots that nonetheless remained coated with a thick layer of dark soil. Washed with water and sliced, the roots tasted like corn, evidence of the sugars the plant exuded to attract microorganisms. About 40 farmers there are building soils with support of Fuhrer and USDA scientist Kristine Nichols.
* Study showed nearly half of the rise in sea level comes from water that runs off agricultural lands. About 70 percent of America’s freshwater goes to agriculture, but compacted soil means that much of it can’t penetrate. Tillage equipment is redesigned periodically to strike deeper and deeper to break up this compacted soil, but this only creates a new and still deeper layer of compaction.
* Conventional farmers remove all vegetation to offer blank slate to one crop, whether it be corn (24 percent of America’s 406 million acres of cropland) or wheat (14 percent) or soybeans (19 percent). Weeds, other plants, and even residue from a previous year’s crop are removed, often in the fall, leaving the soil exposed for up to 7 months. Even most organic farmers conduct this annual ruination of the soil, especially the huge industrial concerns that produce most of the organic products in our grocery stores. They can’t call themselves organic if they use chemical herbicides to get rid of weeds, so they till them away.
* Chemical farming has only been around for about 50 years, when German-Jewish scientist Fritz Haber figured out how to pull nitrogen from the air. Now most chemical fertilizers are a mixture of: nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. But scientists are pinpointing more and more nutrients in foods that are important for our health.
* “When we add fertilizer, we’re putting nutrients right next to the plant roots and the plant doesn’t have to give up any carbon to get them,” says USDA microbiologist Kristine Nichols. “Therefore, the soil organisms can’t get enough food.”
* This causes a vicious cycle of needing more and more fertilizer to get a crop. Conventional agriculture uses about 32 billion pounds of chemical fertilizers annually, but they are remarkably inefficient:
    * Much of the phosphorus in chemical fertilizers quickly binds to minerals in the soil and becomes unavailable to the plants.
    * Up to 50 percent of the nitrogen is lost, washed away with the rain or irrigation water into the groundwater or streams where it causes algal growth, which sucks oxygen out of the water and creates dead zones.
* **Rising price of chemical fertilizers has many farmers looking for a better way.** 
* The Smalls practice what began 15 years earlier on Gabe Brown's farm outside Bismarck.
* Eliav Bitan, agriculture advisor to the National Wildlife Federation’s Climate and Energy Program, was tasked with reporting on future friendly farming practices since NWF determined global climate change was the greatest threat to wildlife.
* Brown went no till in 1993 and slowly departed from conventional wisdom, working with Fuhrer to test different legumes and observing the synergy with the grasses that increased production.
* And then he had his epic, crushing, biblical-level bout with nature. For 4 years in a
row, weather anomalies—either hail or late frost or extreme drought—wiped out most of
his crops. For 4 years, he couldn’t take much of anything to market. To make do, he sowed
his ruined fields with summer crops just to have some feed for his cattle. He tried sowing
corn in 1997, but the plants withered in a drought. Instead of clearing the field
mechanically with a tractor and disc, he sent in his cows to eat the stalks. He also sowed
cover crops in the fall—these are plants grown in the market-crop off-season to protect
the soil from wind and rain erosion—hoping they might improve moisture. He noticed that
his soil health seemed to be improving, but really, survival and hanging on to the farm
were his only concerns.
“That fourth year, we lost 80 percent of our crop to hail,” Brown recalled. “It’s
awfully tough to make bank payments when you have no income. That was a tough time,
but it was the best thing that could have happened because I never would be where I am
today without those 4 years. We were forced to change.”
By this time, Brown couldn’t afford to buy fertilizer—he was broke—but he realized
that his departures from conventional agricultural practices had been improving his soil
55
so much that he might not even need it. So he kept looking for other ways to farm and
ranch successfully without expensive chemicals. In 1998, he took a course in Savory’s
holistic management methods. He learned that set stocking or season-long grazing—those
are terms for what most ranchers do when they turn out their animals to wander one large
pasture for the entire year—encourages the cows to eat their preferred grasses past the
point of recovery and allows weeds to take over. He began the process of turning his
pastureland into more than 100 smaller paddocks and rotating his cattle through them
every few days, allowing the grasses plenty of time to regenerate.
Right around that time, Brown became a supervisor with the Burleigh County Soil
Conservation District, and he and Jay Fuhrer became a convention-busting team, eager to
test any new ideas that sounded promising. Brown expanded his cover-crop mixes to
include a few more varieties, and word started to spread about his healthy soil.
Then Kristine Nichols, at the time a new soil microbiologist with the USDA’s
Agricultural Resource Service in nearby Mandan, came to visit. Impressed by what she
saw going on with Brown’s soil, she urged him to cut back on the amount of chemical
fertilizers he was using (now that his farm was more successful, he’d gone back to using
fertilizer). He recalls her saying, “Gabe, you’ve got to reduce and eventually eliminate
your commercial fertility so your soil biology will function as it should. That’s the only
way your system can become sustainable.”
Brown embarked upon an extended trial to test her suggestion, using fertilizer on half
of each individual field and leaving it off on the other half. After 4 years, the halves
without fertilizer consistently outperformed the other halves, so it was easy to decide to
ditch the cost and bother of applying fertilizer. Clearly, all the other steps he’d taken—not
tilling, the cover crops, the occasional foray by cows to eat crop residue—had changed
the soil so that his crops didn’t need fertilizer. Soil health became an obsession for
Brown at that point, with Fuhrer and Nichols his ever-eager partners.
In 2006, Brown and Fuhrer attended a No-Till on the Plains conference in Kansas. A
Brazilian crop consultant named Ademir Calegari took the dais to talk about the covercrop
“cocktails” farmers were using to build soil health in South America. Cover crops
themselves have been used by farmers for thousands of years to curb erosion and runoff;
the leaves catch raindrops and allow them to drip on the soil slowly, preventing them
from hammering soil particles apart and giving the water more time to percolate down.
Despite these benefits, cover crops are not widely used in the United States. In fact, a
National Wildlife Federation study showed that in 2011, only a maximum of 4.3 million
acres of the Mississippi River Basin’s 277 million acres was planted in cover crops.
Gabe Brown had noticed that water runoff from his cropland dropped dramatically
after he started using his simple two- and three-species cover-crop mixes, and as he
learned more about the science of soil health, he suspected that the cover crops were
doing more than just reducing erosion and runoff. The cover crops ensured that his soil
56
biology was being fed throughout the year, not just while he was growing his commodity
crops of wheat and corn. With these underground engineers building soil aggregates and
organic matter year-round, his land had become spongelike, soaking in and holding water
so that his crops thrived even during dry weather.
The cocktails that Ademir Calegari suggested bumped the cover-crop concept to a
new level. One of the most unnatural practices of conventional farming is its creation of
vast landscapes in which only one plant is grown, usually corn or wheat or soybeans. But
such “monocultures” never occur in nature. A square foot of the native prairie near Gabe
Brown’s farm has up to 140 plant species. An acre of land alongside any American
highway probably has more plant species than all of Iowa’s cropped lands put together. A
lush mixture of plants aboveground means that there is a correspondingly lush community
of microorganisms underground, as the different plants offer different root exudates and
attract an array of different microorganisms, making the soil overall more resilient.
Nature is always trying to restore balance to landscapes that humans degrade. When we
create bare land, nature sends a battalion of weeds to colonize and cover the soil. When
we establish a monoculture, nature sends in pathogens to weaken and even kill that crop,
allowing other species to fill the void.
“If you grow a monocrop for an extended period of time, you’re promoting pathogens
that are specific to that crop,” says John Klironomos, a biologist at the University of
British Columbia. “This stimulates diversity. Nature won’t let any one species dominate a
particular area, but pathogens won’t find a host in a very diverse agricultural system.”
Ironic that we immediately think that crops are sick when they’re afflicted with a
pathogen, when this is nature’s way of making the landscape healthy again.
Gabe and Jay left the No-Till on the Plains conference eager to put Calegari’s
concept into trials. They went to the grain elevator, which not only receives and pays for
commodity crops but also sells seed. They flummoxed the folks there by requesting 1,000
pounds of turnip seed. “How many seed packets do you want?” was the astonished reply.
But finally, Brown and Fuhrer gathered up enough bulk seed to plant test fields on
conservation district land, some as monocultures and some as cocktails. Soil health
seemed to improve with the cocktails. The drama came during the dry summer of 2006,
when the county got only an inch of rain between the time that they sowed the trial fields
in May and clipped and weighed the growth in late July, some 70 days later. Most of the
monoculture crops died, but the cover-crop cocktail fields had grown like mad. “That
showed us that there was a tremendous beneficial influence from growing these crops
together,” Gabe said. He began planting cover-crop cocktails himself.
The next arc of his learning curve came in 2008, when he spoke at a grazing
conference in Manitoba. A rancher named Neil Dennis from Saskatchewan approached
him after his talk and told him about his experiment with another innovative practice
called mob grazing. Brown typically ran 50,000 pounds of cattle on an acre—about 40
57
cows—but Dennis was running an astounding million pounds of cattle per acre. Brown
sat up until 3:00 in the morning looking at photos on Dennis’s computer. The following
June, he visited Dennis’s operation and was stunned by the health of his soil.
The mob grazing concept builds upon the insights of André Voisin and Allan Savory,
namely that even very large numbers of animals are good for the land if one controls the
amount of time they spend there. With carefully monitored grazing times that gave the
plants time to recover, Dennis found that the beneficial impacts of herbivores on the land
were multiplied by having lots of them there: lots of hooves breaking up the hard surface
of the soil, lots of grasses trampled into the ground, lots of grasses being tugged and bitten
and causing the plants to pulse carbon sugars into the soil, and lots of nutritious dung,
urine, and hair spread around for the insects and microorganisms to break down.
Now, the Browns have a winning trifecta of soil-health practices: no-till planting
combined with cover-crop cocktails, followed by mob grazing. They currently turn nearly
three-quarters of a million pounds of cattle onto their pastures and also let them storm the
cover-crop-cocktail fields. Not that there haven’t been other innovations, as well—
Brown says he wants to make sure he and Paul fail at one new thing every year, maybe
more, just to make sure they’re stretching. For instance, most ranchers arrange their cows’
breeding cycle so that they give birth in late winter, inside corrals. The Browns decided
they wanted their cows to give birth in May, out on the fresh grass and in the sunshine.
“Out there, the cow is consuming a healthy fresh diet instead of hay or something that took
fossil fuels to get in front of her,” Brown said. “And it’s a clean environment for the
newborn, no different from that of the bison or antelope or deer.” This innovation wasn’t
a failure!
There are now chickens on the farm as well as sheep, adding to the diversity of
impact on and inputs into the land. Basically, that’s what the Browns are always looking
for: ways to stack enterprises on the farm so that they make more money on the same
acreage and keep building soil health. When Gabe Brown first met Kris Nichols, she told
him that the herd under the soil was just as large as the herd on top of the soil, but far
more important for the long-term success of his operation. “You have to think about
managing the organisms in the soil the way you think about managing for any healthy
herd,” she told me when I visited her at the Mandan research center. “They need constant
and high-nutritive-value food sources. They need a good habitat. They need protection
from diseases and predators. When Gabe manages his cattle, he’s utilizing them as a tool
to manage the soil for that other herd.”
When Gabe Brown takes visitors around, they admire the cows munching amiably on
acres of green. But he’s thinking about that much larger herd down in the soil, steadily
lapping up the carbon sugars and turning them into black gold.
By the time I visited him in the summer of 2012, Brown was famous—between his
speaking gigs and visits from scientists and farming consultants, it was like trying to get
58
on a rock star’s schedule. His son, Paul, had made T-shirts to mark this transformation,
navy blues with Brown’s face and GABE MANIA! on the front in white and WORLD
TOUR 2012 on the back, along with a list of all the places where he had spoken. Gabe
modestly declined to show me one. He was producing 127 bushels of corn per acre, 27
more bushels than the county average, without fertilizer, pesticides, or fungicides, and
with just a small amount of herbicide. He was spending between $1.00 to $1.25 to
produce that bushel, whereas the county’s average cost per bushel was between $3.00 to
$3.50. The corn and wheat were sold to standard commodity markets, and the cattle to
specialty buyers of grass-fed beef. The soil organic matter in his cropped lands has gone
from 1.7 to 5.3 percent, which he thinks is not nearly high enough—he’d like to get the
croplands as high as his pastures, which are at 7.3 percent. His son, Paul, is determined
to get both up to 12 percent. While other farmers continued to think that they needed to
buy more land and become larger to be successful—that’s been the assumption for years
—Gabe Brown decided to become smaller. He was making enough money that he could
sacrifice acreage—he discontinued leases on 640 extra acres—allowing him to spend
more effort fine-tuning his management.
Gabe Brown was scowling at the sky when Eliav Bitan and I arrived. A silvery cropdusting
plane streamed a contrail of pesticide over a distant field of sunflowers. Brown
was as dismayed as if it were the Wicked Witch of the West from the Oz fantasy spelling,
“Surrender Dorothy” in the sky. “That just makes me sick,” he said. “I don’t want that
stuff drifting over on my crops.”
Then we climbed into his black four-door truck, his border collie Pistol leaping into
the back just as we pulled away from the house, and raised our own contrail of dust. We
headed off to see a 60-acre field that Paul had sowed with cover-crop cocktails, half with
19 species and half with 26—another trial to educate themselves about soil health. We
drove past the odd nomenclature of North Dakota country roads—they had names like
First Avenue South and 102 Avenue Southeast to help firemen and police map their way to
far-flung homes, but the names looked odd on intersections with no buildings in sight. We
drove past fields that were green and fields that had already had their hay harvested and
spun into big golden cylinders.
Paul’s field was one of the green ones. Sunflowers raised their fist-size buds high. So
many shorter plants of varying heights crowded around them that it looked as if the
sunflowers could have stood upright, even without roots. When I bent in to look closer, I
saw tiny flowers—white and yellow and blue—dangling in the green. I spied pinkish
disks of turnip and radish in the soil below. “We’re going for a forest canopy structure
here,” Brown said, more for my benefit than Bitan’s—he’d heard all this before. “Like a
rainforest, with high, medium, and low layers to the canopy. And we want different leaf
types, too, different shapes. They’re my solar collectors. No matter what angle the
sunlight is, we’re collecting the maximum amount of energy.”

He reached out to touch a dainty blue flower. It was flax, which they plant because
the cattle don’t like to eat it. In fact, they only leave the cows in the field long enough to
eat 25 percent of the plant material (and yes, they eat the turnips but just nibble at the
radishes). The rest is stomped to the ground for the other herd. Brown reached for a sprig
of buckwheat, which he and Paul plant because it scavenges phosphorous from the soil
and makes it available to other plants. He pointed out the plants that had 8-foot roots and
those with shallow ones. Just as they want the plants to fill up the space above the soil,
they want the roots to occupy all areas of the soil profile below. “That’s biological
tillage,” Brown said. “That’s nature’s way of getting rid of soil compaction.”
Fine-limbed gray spiders climbed up his arms as he spoke. Behind him, a scrim of
white butterflies drifted through the field. When I remarked upon the abundance of insects,
he nodded. “We had an entomologist out here the other day, and he was just amazed. He
was like a kid in a candy store.”
Brown’s farm is like a candy store to scientists who are interested in studying natural
systems in agriculture (or who aren’t chemical-spray-loving “nozzle-heads,” as some
people call the researchers in conventional agriculture). The visiting entomologist was
Jonathan Lundgren from the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service in Brookings, South
Dakota, and he was dazzled by the impact Brown’s cover crops were having on his insect
community.
“Most farmers think that if they see an insect, they have to kill it,” Lundgren told me
on the phone. “But there are only 3,000 insect pests in the world that eat our crops and
hurt our livestock. For each one of those pests, there are around 3,000 beneficial insects.
We don’t even have names for most of them yet. Spraying wipes out that whole insect
community, including the enemies of those pests. I’d like to see us manage our fields so
that we keep those beneficial insects around.”
And that’s what he’s finding in Brown’s fields. Brown doesn’t know exactly which
plants are attracting the predators of the agricultural pests; he just tries to make sure that
his cover-crop mixes attract pollinators and that they provide a good habitat for spiders.
He assumes that if he maintains plant diversity on the ground, insect diversity will follow.
And even though studies haven’t shown why this approach is working—Lundgren plans to
help with that—Brown knows his approach is working. He hasn’t used pesticides in 12
years and hasn’t needed to.
For instance, Brown doesn’t have trouble with the corn rootworm, a beetle larva that
eats corn roots, which Lundgren says is the number one agricultural pest in America.
Billions of pesticide dollars are spent every year to combat this pest, but they also harm
the rest of the insect community—and they wind up creating super pests when the bad
insects develop resistance to the poison. Lundgren has been investigating the stomachs of
other insects for evidence of corn rootworm DNA and has identified dozens of predators.
“The predator community will be there if we provide the right environment for them,” he
60
explained. Gabe Brown’s fields are attracting the predators, and Lundgren suspects that
something else is going on, too. He believes that the cover-crop cocktails are changing the
root structure of the corn plants and inducing the corn rootworm to venture away from the
protection of the roots where they are nailed by predators. When I spoke to him in 2013,
he had submitted a grant proposal to the USDA to research how, exactly, the diverse plant
and insect varieties in Brown’s fields are working together to defeat the corn rootworm.
Brown’s lively insect population may also be the cause of his dwindling need for
herbicides. Insects don’t eat just plants and other insects; they’re also granivores that eat
seeds. Most of the crops that farmers sow have been bred to bear large seeds, which
aren’t appealing to these small granivores. But weeds have tiny seeds and a vigorous
propagation mechanism that shoots out thousands of the seeds—millions in many species
—over the course of a growing season. These tiny seeds are a tasty meal to the right
insect. Unwittingly, farmers who kill off their insect populations to get rid of one pest may
be making it easier for their weeds to dominate.
Gabe Brown doesn’t always know exactly why these diverse plant and insect
populations have such a positive impact on his business; he just has all the anecdotal
evidence he needs to convince himself and many others that they do. But Lundgren enjoys
figuring out the science behind the success, especially since no one else has even thought
of researching these complex relationships. It’s a great partnership. “I’ve really learned
from Gabe,” he says. “He’s as much driving my research program as I’m helping him, if
not more. The stuff he and some of these other progressive farmers are doing is the future
of farming.”
In fact, one of the things that distinguishes these progressive farmers and ranchers is
their eagerness to work with progressive scientists—meaning those whose work is not
hog-tied by the vast research budgets of the corporations that make money on fertilizers
and other products that work against nature, or by the academic agriculture departments
that survive on those budgets. Brown also has a great partnership with Rick Haney, a soil
scientist with the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service in Temple, Texas.
Haney came from a farming family and always wanted to be a farmer himself, but he
couldn’t afford to buy land when he left college in the 1980s. So he went into soil science
and has farmed his research station’s 200-acre test plot for the last 12 years. Unlike the
city-raised Brown, he had been schooled by his family to adhere to the rules of
conventional farming. “I’d been tilling forever,” he told me. “It wasn’t until just a couple
of years ago that it hit me that I was destroying nature’s brilliantly designed underground
system to move minerals and nutrients and water.”
Haney’s real education about the soil came from studying Gabe Brown and other
farmers. He soon realized that the way his profession analyzed soil was completely
inadequate and outdated. Most of the soil tests that are currently in use were designed
between 40 and 60 years ago, and they reflect the mind-set of an earlier age, which
61
viewed soil as a mixture of chemicals rather than a complex, living system. He decided to
create a soil test that reflected this natural complexity. “I’m a big fan of nature,” he says.
“Nature has about 3 billion years of research and development. I try to mimic in the lab
what nature does outside.”
Soil samples are routinely dried in a kiln so that they all have the same moisture
content and are therefore comparable. One of Haney’s innovations is that he rewets that
dried sample, then measures the amount of carbon dioxide gassed off over 24 hours.
When the sample is dry, the microorganisms become dormant. When it’s wetted again,
they wake up, get back to work, and begin to breathe. That pulse of carbon dioxide
reveals the vitality of the microorganism community and the soil’s overall fertility. When
Haney first tried to publish a paper about this drying and rewetting method, a reviewer at
one journal commented, “You can’t do that. It’s too simple.”
Haney also devised a method to get a better bead on soil nutrients. Conventional soil
testing uses harsh chemicals to extract minerals from a sample, but Haney felt that these
chemicals caused an incorrect measurement because they pull things from the soil that
aren’t actually available to the plants. So he came up with his own water-based extractant
based on the chemistry of the root exudates. His test also looks for all the different forms
of various nutrients. For instance, conventional soil tests typically only look for inorganic
nitrogen, but Haney had observed that plants were thriving in soils that had only half as
much inorganic nitrogen as the experts deemed adequate. Using scientific techniques
perfected only in the last decade, Haney’s test also measures the organic nitrogen in the
soil that the other tests miss.
Haney offers farmers this more accurate depiction of what’s actually going on in their
soils, coupled with advice about cover-crop cocktails that include combinations of
grasses and legumes to get the maximum benefit from the huge pool of nitrogen already in
most soils. This allows farmers to cut back on their nitrogen fertilizer—an
environmentally sound move and a huge cost cutter for the farmers. “These fertilizers
have been used for 50 years as an insurance policy because they were fairly cheap,”
Haney says. “That’s not the case today, so there’s a lot more interest in getting by with
less.”
Plato said that “necessity is the mother of invention” (at least Wikipedia ascribes it to
Plato; I was pretty sure it wasn’t Frank Zappa!), and farmers and ranchers are facing
some stark necessities these days. The rising cost of chemical inputs is certainly one of
them; the other is the unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change. Soil
microbiologist Kristine Nichols suspects that the agriculturalists in Burleigh County have
been more inventive and receptive to change because they work in such an unforgiving
climate: They have a short growing season and frequent drought. But as the rest of the
nation found out in the drought of 2012, no one can assume there will be an abundance of
rain at the right time. The challenge is to build healthy soils so that every drop of rain
62
goes to good use.
The high point of my visit to Gabe Brown’s farm came after we left Paul’s field and
churned over a gravel road to one of Gabe’s cornfields. He had been carrying around a
slim 4-foot metal rod. He told me it was a moisture probe, but he had been using it to
point out the different plants and insects in Paul’s field. Then we walked into the
cornfield, which seemed to be at least a foot taller than any of the neighbors’, and he
nudged it into a bit of bare soil. And then—and then!—he pushed all 4 feet of the rod
straight into the ground, all the way up to his knuckles.
“I can’t believe that!” I think I dropped my recorder. “Do it again!”
So he walked a few feet away and shoved the rod into the soil again, then pulled it
out and held it out to me. “You try it.”
My arms aren’t nearly as substantial as Brown’s. Where his arms bulge with muscle,
mine jiggle. Without much expectation of success, I took the rod and pushed it into the
ground. I tried it in several places. And each time, I pushed the rod all the way up to my
knuckles. I knew what an amazing thing this was, since I’ve been a backyard gardener
ever since I was 25. Even after years of babying my beds with bags of compost, I never
had soil like that in Gabe Brown’s cornfield. I could hardly stick a fork in my lawn back
in Cleveland! But through his management of this harsh landscape, he had created soil that
was so rich with microbial life that they had built aggregates going down at least 4 feet.
Four feet of carbon-rich soil, stacked with billions of tiny cups to hold water.
Brown shrugged. “I don’t worry about drought.”
We tried the moisture probe in another of Brown’s cornfields as well as in a crazy
field where he has 75 species of flowers and vegetables planted for his family and the
local food bank—it’s a nutritional jungle where you can’t take a step without crushing a
banquet-size portion of vegetables. The only place the moisture probe wouldn’t penetrate
was in his neighbor’s field, who is a no-till farmer who hasn’t tried the cover-crop
cocktail and some of Brown’s other innovations.
What would happen if all agriculture went the way of Gabe Brown’s farm? After we
spent the day walking around his fields, we sat in a barn to talk and watch a slide show
Eliav Bitan had prepared. Bitan had gathered up the meager scientific studies on some of
these “future-friendly farming” practices. Even a modest two-or-three species cover crop
causes a 90 percent reduction in sediment runoff and a 50 percent reduction in fertilizer
runoff into the watershed, and sequesters a metric ton of carbon dioxide per acre. Bitan
added together the measured impact of simple cover crops and other helpful practices—
although none, in these studies, was undertaken to improve soil health—and surmised that
these practices on US cropland could absorb 5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the
United States. But he thinks that estimate falls far short of the real potential.
“What if you were actually trying to maximize the soil?” he asked. “Could the soil
63
absorb a fifth of our greenhouse gas emissions? Some people think we can, but the
science just doesn’t exist yet.”
How might healthy soils affect the annual flooding that goes on in North Dakota and
other states? Floods cause around $8 billion in damage every year, and states spend
billions to prevent them—North Dakota alone plans to invest nearly $2 billion in a 35-
mile flood diversion channel around Fargo. But what if the rain penetrated the land, as it
does on Gabe Brown’s farm, instead of running off? It took him 15 years to create the kind
of healthy soil that can absorb a very heavy rainfall, which is another commonplace of
climate change. But now he has little fear of flooding. In 1993, an infiltration test of the
soil in one of his fields showed that it could only absorb a half-inch of rain in an hour. A
2012 test showed that the same field can now absorb 8 inches in a hour.
Many soil scientists are stuck in their labs and research plots, but Kris Nichols’s job
compels her to spend time with farmers and try to make the science serve their needs.
Besides, she’s deeply interested in what’s going on out there. Her father was the
commissioner of agriculture in Minnesota and her family has a long history with the
challenges of farming. “My career was probably supposed to be looking at fungi,” she
said with a laugh when I visited her in Mandan. “A fungus caused the potato famine in
Ireland and that brought my family to this country!”
Just as she has helped Gabe Brown change, he’s helped her change, too. “Sometimes
education can be limiting,” she told me. “We think we can go just so far, but what Gabe
and Marlyn and the others have shown me is that we can go a lot farther. They’ve shown
me something unbelievable.”
Nichols stands out among her peers, not all of whom are convinced that enough
carbon can be captured and stored stably enough in the soil to make an impact on global
warming. They look at the most intransigent part of soil carbon, called humin—the part
that’s been eaten and processed by microorganisms so many times that it’s nearly inert—
and note that it takes hundreds and even thousands of years for that sort of evolution.
Some of these other soil scientists aren’t impressed by the many other less-concentrated
forms of carbon in the soil, because that carbon could more easily be lost to the
atmosphere. But Nichols pointed out that farmers like Gabe Brown are adding vaster
amounts of carbon to the soil than any of their agricultural predecessors did. And given
their dense concentrations of cover crops, much of the carbon they add comes from root
exudates, which become humin more quickly. In short, she said, these other scientists
aren’t familiar with the innovations of the Burleigh County farmers and other agricultural
pioneers around the county.
“Some of the things we’re doing with cover crops and livestock are adding so much
more value than the old conservation methods,” Nichols explained. “Will that restore the
prairies’ native carbon content? Personally, I think it’s possible.”
64
There’s another reason I love the story of the Burleigh County farmers and ranchers.
Most people think that good agriculture is a luxury reserved for boutique farmers who
work a day job as computer programmers or whatever. Gabe Brown and his colleagues
have shown that when you understand nature and work with her, farming becomes easier
and cheaper, not harder and more costly.
“If we get out of the way, nature will do most of the work,” Rick Haney told me. And
that’s the path of least resistance that Brown follows. He crisscrosses his fields with
heavy machinery far less than he used to. He sprays hardly any chemicals. His two herds
—cattle and microbes—clear up his fields. And he doesn’t want genetically
mollycoddled cows that don’t know how to be cows. When he turns them out onto snowcovered
fields, he expects them to nuzzle aside the snow and eat the cover crops buried
there. He expects them to figure out how to meet their moisture needs with snow so he
doesn’t have to drag water out to them. If they don’t, he sells them and invests in sturdier
stock.
When the soil tour visited Marlyn Richter’s farm, Richter regaled the crowd with
stories of his parents’ disapproval when he and his brother wanted to change the routine.
He had been equally scornful himself only a few years earlier. The Richter brothers are
third-generation farmers. His grandfather bought the farm during the Dust Bowl years. His
parents raised 14 children there and still live there themselves.
“I used to see Gabe Brown with his soil charts and his talk about water infiltration,
and I’d think that it was all BS,” Richter told the group. A big guy, he was wearing a gym
T-shirt, and his chest and arms suggested he went often. “I was tilling and I thought, ‘No
way that water’s not going down!’ But I was driven to change by struggling with these
sandy soils.” Then he waved his hand at one of the fields, which used to be so hard that it
was tough to sink a plow into it. Now he’s gone no-till, planted cover crops, and grazes
his just-weaned calves on it. His soil has gone from 0.8 to 2.6 percent organic matter, and
he’s reduced his herbicides and cut his fertilizer use by 15 percent.
He and his brother are also working less. They now take Sundays off. That really
shocks their father, who was so convinced of the need for grueling, grinding, never-ending
work on the farm that he used to tell the boys to hoist an anvil and carry it around if they
seemed to be slacking.
I repeated this story to Gabe Brown in his basement and he laughed. “I tease my
buddy Marlyn all the time that he’s not moving fast enough,” he said. “They need to get rid
of all the commercial fertility. They need to put those milk cows out to graze. They’re
doing things like chopping up feed and bringing it to the cattle. We used to do that years
ago, too, but we want to let nature run its course. Let the cattle do the work.”
He settled his cap back on his head. “Marlyn’s got to get lazier.”
