# The soil will save us: how scientists, farmers, and foodies are healing the soil to save the planet
Kristin Ohlson, 2014

# Introduction

Ohlson described her history of lawn woes, largely due to apathy, before a change in 2011. Many solutions involved chemicals, but she settled on a recommendation of aeration, compost and reseeding. She didn't have enough compost, but covered the lawn with fallen leaves instead of disposing of them.

Cleveland restauranteur Parker Bosley sought local ingredients since late 1980s and influenced farmers to sell directly and improve quality all around. He alerted Ohlson to "carbon farming" or "soil farming" or "microbe farming", practice taking hold among small farmers. Even the 70% (American Farm Bureau) who don't believe in global warming still took part due to benefits to lands, crops and animals.
# Chapter 1: Where Did All the Carbon Go?

Humans began farming more than 10,000 years ago and were plowing by 2500 BCE. By the 1980s, scientists and the U.S. government have recognized a connection between loss of carbon in farmed soils and greenhouse gases that apparently cause global climate change. Studies found cultivated lands worldwide have lost 80% or more of soil carbon, largely due to tilling, removal of plant waste, overgrazing due to captive herds and use of chemicals, all of which destroys the soil microbiome. Soil scientists and visionary (mostly small and educated) farmers are finding ways to reverse the trend, often by taking cues from nature:  no tilling, no chemicals, herds of free range animals, scattering plant waste on the fields. Benefits include better water absorption, drought tolerance, healthier plants and animals and carbon sequestration. Changing farming practices worldwide might reverse the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policymakers are taking note but have not much followed through, but the growth of small farmers and interested groups is a promising trend.
* Farmer Abe Collins transformed his land using Rattan Lal and others' ideas and became soil carbon evangelist* Rattan Lal, director of Ohio State University's Carbon Management and Sequestration Center (C-MASC) speaks around world about connection between soil carbon and global warming.
    * Plot 87 of the Waterman Agricultural and Natural Resources Laboratory
    * Book: The Potential of US Cropland to Sequester Carbon and Mitigate the Greenhouse Effect
    * no till agriculture: plowing damages soil structure and exposes soil carbon to oxygen, causing it to float off as CO2
    * recycle crop residue by chopping up and spreading on soil, reducing erosion, regulating temperature, feeding organisms that aerate and enrich soil, making it porous and absorbent
* Lal worked in Africa 13 years researching ways to help local farmers, who practiced slash and burn techniques, resulting in fields lasting only a few years and diminishing forest remaining.
* Broadened perspective when visited in 1982 by Roger Revelle, oceanographer who was among first to connect rising greenhouse gases with climate change.
* By 1987, USDA and the EPA started monitoring; Lal and others formed soil carbon working group to quantify loss and determine recovery prospects.
* Farming started up to 13,000 years ago, with simple tools by 5000 BCE and animal driven plows by 2500BCE.
    * Nature hasn't evolved to account for repeated soil perturbations!
    * Modern farming even worse because heavy machinery compacts soil, requiring even deeper plowing.
    * Before humans, herds of roaming animals grazed on plants and left manure, never staying in one place long due to predators. Now, without fear of predators, animals in small fenced areas eat plants to ground and even pull out roots.
    * This stops plant photosynthesis from storing carbon in soil as humus, long lasting carbon molecule networks, which fertilizes and gives airy texture.
* Lal led studies calculating Ohio lost 50% soil carbon in last 200 years, and in areas of world with longer cultivation history, 80% or more.
* **Prospects to fix**
    * While many clean energy projects aim to reduce emissions, none will reduce existing CO2 without great expense.
    * "The greatest opportunities are in the parts of the world where carbon has been most depleted by thousands of years of farming, in sub-Saharan Africa, south and central Asia, and Central America."
    * Lal thinks 3 billion tons of carbon can be sequestered annually in world's soils, reducing CO2 by 3ppm yearly; others  more optimistic, esp outside academia
    * Lal spoke to Congress six times, seven intl conferences in 2011 alone addressed soil/climate, but not much followthrough: “I tell them about 25-year sustainability plans, but they only have a four-year span of attention.”* **agrarian renaissance due to demand for sustainably raised foods**
    * number of small farmers (often college educated) in the U.S. growing for first time since Great Depression
    * reducing or eliminating fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, hormones, antibiotics, etc., letting animals graze on grass instead of forcing unnatural diets => soil gets blacker, richer with carbon
    * new farmers becoming citizen scientists and entrepreneurs looking to get paid for carbon crop
    * environmental community leery of softening emissions reduction pressure on energy and industry sectors
# Chapter 2: The Marriage of Light and Dark
Plants and myriad soil organisms have a long evolutionary history of interdependence that we are only just starting to understand. In addition to producing healthier plants, healthy soils provide drought protection, flood prevention, purification of water and carbon sequestration. With greenhouse gases skyrocketing as they are, soil based carbon sequestration may be the only viable option to reverse global climate change.* Original “polluters” were cyanobacteria—blue-green photosynthetic, aquatic bacteria that gave rise to plants—which began to change the balance of gases in our atmosphere some 2.9 BYA when planet was around 1.6 BYO.
    * Probably first were archaea (“ancient”) that live deep in the ocean near volcanic vents.    * Bacteria evolved 3.5 BYA and lived in ocean (not enough oxygen in atmosphere to protect from sun’s killer ultraviolet light).
    * First photoautotrophs were purple bacteria that captured light with pigment similar to the heme pigment in blood. Electrons from sulfur powered the conversion of solar energy into cellular energy.
    * After cyanobacteria got electrons from water (liberating oxygen), they could now spread further. Earth’s atmosphere was ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and methane, with a mere 2 percent oxygen; cyanobacteria cranked it up to 21 percent.
    * An alga swallowed a cyanobacterium 1.6 BYA; photosynthetic algae used green chlorophylls to absorb light from highly energetic blue and red wavelengths.
    * Ample energy led to multicellular organisms.
    * Plants and cyanobacteria require carbon dioxide to produce sugars; every cell in a plant contains chlorophyll and thus carries on photosynthesis.
* Mutually beneficial relationships cycling nutrients formed.
    * Bacteria and cyanobacteria broke down rock to minerals, fungi recycled organic waste.
    * Plants evolved to use "soil food web", produce root exudates and leak up to 40% of their carbon sugars .
    * Microorganisms exchange by solubilizing nutrients (from sand, silt and clay) needed to build mass and create enzymes for biological activity.
    * Teaspoonful of healthy soil contains 1–7 billion organisms, as many as 75,000 species of bacteria, 25,000 species of fungi, 1,000 species of protozoa, and 100 species of nematodes.
    * Later came mycorrhizae ("fungi"+"roots") that connected root systems of many plants, exchanging sugar for nutrients, enabling grasses to evolve to shrubs and trees.* Microorganisms first discovered 1600s; not recognized as beneficial till late 1800s when soil scientists found fungal hyphae everywhere with healthy plants but not in human disturbed areas.
* Further descriptions carried out, but little studying function, possibly due to lack of funding and difficulty. Microorganisms in the soil are part of a complex system and can’t really be understood in isolation. Some 99 percent of soil organisms can’t be grown in a lab for study.* First understanding in 1980s when biologist Dave Coleman urged his Natural Resource Ecology Lab (NREL) at Colorado State University to start trying to figure it out.
* Hired microbiologist Elaine Ingham to investigate complex roles and relationships among the soil biology.
    * Five groups of microorganisms: fungi, bacteria, mobile one-celled organisms called protozoa, tiny worms called nematodes, and microarthropods, which are related to crustaceans and insects.
    * Visible organisms: earthworms, beetles, voles, etc.
* NREL learned virtually all plants rely on soil microbes intertwined with roots that can extend 200 feet down; even some grasses have 15 foot roots, and microbes have been found as far as 10 miles down in soil.
* Learning of more and more nutrients plants need, and they get all from soil or air with help of microorganisms.
    * Fungi deposit some directly inside root cells.
    * Others such as cobalt and sulfur must be swallowed by bacteria swallowed by protozoa or nematodes or microarthropods and then excreted near root.
    * Carbon comes from the air without help.
    * Bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to form usable by legume plants, which then die and disperse the nitrogen to other plants through the soil.* Mycorrhizal fungi work with many plants and can shoot out their hyphae 250 yards connecting many different plants.* Bacteria more particular; some evolved to eat a particular kind of carbon sugar and will only cluster around a few kinds of plants. Could explain difficulty in restoring degraded habitats.* Bacteria also can be specialized for conditions like temperature and moisture level; some species may be present but not productive till conditions are right.
* Soil aggregates form by bacteria glueing themselves to silt with carbon glue formed from the sugars, forming structure with space for water and gases, which bacteria need to breathe. Then fungi bundle their reproductive parts inside a shall of these structures for protection from predatory microarthropods.
* Clay is tiny rods that line up and prevent water flow, while sand is large particles that can't hold water. In both cases, soil aggregates solve the problem by either jumbling the rods or forming tiny dams among the large grains.* Greenhouse gases     * Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier noted in the early 1800s suggested that our atmosphere provides an insulating blanket which keeps us warm.
    * Later that century, John Tyndall showed atmospheric gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide could absorb and emit enough radiant heat to control the planet’s temperature.
    * In 1896 Svante Arrhenius showed changing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide might explain earth’s cycle of ice ages and temperate periods, and noted that humans might have an influence on this concentration through the burning of coal.
    * In 1938 Guy Stewart Callendar pointed out the links among fossil fuel combustion, rising CO2 levels, and rises in world temperature.
    * In 1959 Bert Bolin and Erik Eriksson showed only some CO2 was absorbed by the ocean, but most drifted back into the atmosphere.
    * In 1958 Harry Wexler of U.S. Weather Bureau secured funding for a permanent station at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii to monitor the gas and tapped a young research chemist named Charles Keeling, who discovered an accurate way to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide and pegged it at 310 parts per million. 
    * In 2005 was 380 ppm; by 2013 was 400 ppm. Stopping all fossil fuel use now would still leave legacy load that'd take thousands of years to dissipate.
    * Handful of scientists and entrepreneurs have plans to remove this legacy load but so far the ideas either have frightening caveats attached or are prohibitively expensive.
* The soil carbon cycle results in longer and longer chains of thousands of carbon atoms, making soil darker.
* Soil chemists called carbon chain compounds "organic" for hundreds of years. Jerome Irving Rodale used term in 1940s for nutritious food produced by agriculture that worked with nature.
* Only 1 to 10 percent of carbon entering soil gets locked away as humin, which can last centuries. (Kristine Nichols, a soil microbiologist with the USDA’s Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory in North Dakota)
