# The soil will save us
## How scientists, farmers, and foodies are healing the soil to save the planet
## Kristin Ohlson, 2014

# Introduction

Ohlson described her history of lawn woes, largely due to apathy, before a change in 2011. Many solutions involved chemicals, but she settled on a recommendation of aeration, compost and reseeding. She didn't have enough compost, but covered the lawn with fallen leaves instead of disposing of them.

Cleveland restauranteur Parker Bosley sought local ingredients since late 1980s and influenced farmers to sell directly and improve quality all around. He alerted Ohlson to "carbon farming" or "soil farming" or "microbe farming", practice taking hold among small farmers. Even the 70% (American Farm Bureau) who don't believe in global warming still took part due to benefits to lands, crops and animals.
# Chapter 1: Where Did All the Carbon Go?

Humans began farming more than 10,000 years ago and were plowing by 2500 BCE. By the 1980s, scientists and the U.S. government have recognized a connection between loss of carbon in farmed soils and greenhouse gases that apparently cause global climate change. Studies found cultivated lands worldwide have lost 80% or more of soil carbon, largely due to tilling, removal of plant waste, overgrazing due to captive herds and use of chemicals, all of which destroys the soil microbiome. Soil scientists and visionary (mostly small and educated) farmers are finding ways to reverse the trend, often by taking cues from nature:  no tilling, no chemicals, herds of free range animals, scattering plant waste on the fields. Benefits include better water absorption, drought tolerance, healthier plants and animals and carbon sequestration. Changing farming practices worldwide might reverse the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policymakers are taking note but have not much followed through, but the growth of small farmers and interested groups is a promising trend.

    * no till agriculture: plowing damages soil structure and exposes soil carbon to oxygen, causing it to float off as CO2
    * recycle crop residue by chopping up and spreading on soil, reducing erosion, regulating temperature, feeding organisms that aerate and enrich soil, making it porous and absorbent
* Lal worked in Africa 13 years researching ways to help local farmers, who practiced slash and burn techniques, resulting in fields lasting only a few years and diminishing forest remaining.
* Broadened perspective when visited in 1982 by Roger Revelle, oceanographer who was among first to connect rising greenhouse gases with climate change.
* By 1987, USDA and the EPA started monitoring; Lal and others formed soil carbon working group to quantify loss and determine recovery prospects.
* Farming started up to 13,000 years ago, with simple tools by 5000 BCE and animal driven plows by 2500BCE.
    * Nature hasn't evolved to account for repeated soil perturbations!
    * Modern farming even worse because heavy machinery compacts soil, requiring even deeper plowing.
    * Before humans, herds of roaming animals grazed on plants and left manure, never staying in one place long due to predators. Now, without fear of predators, animals in small fenced areas eat plants to ground and even pull out roots.
    * This stops plant photosynthesis from storing carbon in soil as humus, long lasting carbon molecule networks, which fertilizes and gives airy texture.
* Lal led studies calculating Ohio lost 50% soil carbon in last 200 years, and in areas of world with longer cultivation history, 80% or more.
* **Prospects to fix**
    * While many clean energy projects aim to reduce emissions, none will reduce existing CO2 without great expense.
    * "The greatest opportunities are in the parts of the world where carbon has been most depleted by thousands of years of farming, in sub-Saharan Africa, south and central Asia, and Central America."
    * Lal thinks 3 billion tons of carbon can be sequestered annually in world's soils, reducing CO2 by 3ppm yearly; others  more optimistic, esp outside academia
    * Lal spoke to Congress six times, seven intl conferences in 2011 alone addressed soil/climate, but not much followthrough: “I tell them about 25-year sustainability plans, but they only have a four-year span of attention.”* **agrarian renaissance due to demand for sustainably raised foods**
    * number of small farmers (often college educated) in the U.S. growing for first time since Great Depression

# Chapter 2: The Marriage of Light and Dark

* ample energy led to multicellular organisms
* plants and cyanobacteria require carbon dioxide to produce sugars, though every cell in a plant contains chlorophyll and thus carries on photosynthesis
* mutually beneficial relationships cycling nutrients: bacteria and cyanobacteria broke down rock to minerals, fungi recycled organic waste
* plants evolved to use "soil food web", produce root exudates and leak up to 40% of their carbon sugars 
* microorganisms exchange by solubilizing nutrients (from sand, silt and clay) needed to build mass and create enzymes for biological activity
* teaspoonful of healthy soil contains 1–7 billion organisms, as many as 75,000 species of bacteria, 25,000 species of fungi, 1,000 species of protozoa, and 100 species of nematodes

* .”So began one of life’s great biological partnerships, a marvel of mutualism andcoevolution. This partnership provided plants with enough nutrients to survive their harshnew environment without the protective lap of water, grow more complicated biomass,and spread their green across the land. And in exchange, the microorganisms receivedprecious carbon sugars as well as protein and carbohydrates from the plant—truly, theelixir of life, the first superfood—and paved the way for the eventual evolution ofanimals.Maybe the plants leaked carbon sugars from their earliest days and the bacteria gotwind of this feast and made it their business to set up shop nearby. Or, maybe the plantsbegan leaking carbon sugars in order to attract the microorganisms. Because this is nevera one-way exchange in which the microorganisms leech off the hardworking plants andgive nothing in return. Instead, plants and soil microorganisms have developed asophisticated trading network over the millennia by which plants shunt up to 40 percent oftheir carbon sugars to their roots and microorganisms pay for these goodies by delivering24a mix of minerals to the door like pizza deliverymen. Plants need these minerals to buildmass and create enzymes for biological activity, and the creatures who eat them requirethe minerals to build healthy bodies. Australian ecologist Christine Jones calls thissymbiosis “the very first carbon-trading scheme.”The partnership became even more complex and rewarding with the later evolutionof mycorrhizae (from the Greek words myco for “fungi” and rhizae for “roots,” andcommonly called mycorrhizal fungi). By then, the most sophisticated plants wereproductive grasses—ones that produced grain heads—but they didn’t have the energyresources to move much beyond that point. Fungi that possibly began as root parasites thatpierced plant roots with tiny threadlike hyphae to suck out the cytoplasm “realized” (it’shard not to assign intent!) that siphoning out carbon sugars and depositing a payment innutrients was better than killing or weakening the host plant. The plants not only survivedthe penetration, but also thrived since the hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi range far and wideand can connect whole communities of plants with nutrients. With this fungal root systemin place, plants had more energy to put into reproduction and reaching toward the sun.Thus came shrubs and trees.Fossils from the early Devonian period about 400 million years ago show preservedplant roots encasing ancient hyphae. And mycorrhizal fungi swap nutrients with plants inexactly the same fashion today. Scientists estimate that the roots of 80 percent of earth’splants are intertwined with these hidden helpmates.But life underground is far more complicated than even that scenario, which is farmore complex than anything I had ever imagined. I always thought plants absorbednutrients through their roots without needing microscopic allies. If someone had told methat fungi were penetrating the roots of my beloved bee balms or daylilies, I’d haveassumed that was a problem. How long have people known about these complexrelationships and trading systems going on under our feet?Really, not that long.Anton van Leeuwenhoek was one of the first to see and describe bacteria, back in the17th century. He was far from a trained scientist—he was a Dutch fabric merchant bytrade, but had also worked as a surveyor, a wine assayer, and a city official in Delft. Hekept interesting company, and was the trustee of the painter Johannes Vermeer. He had alively mind and a talent for tinkering. Inspired by a popular book of the day showingimages of bird wing feathers, bugs, and other natural objects under a compoundmicroscope (one that uses more than one lens), he decided to try making his own. Hewound up building more than 500 simple microscopes, some of which magnified over200 times—impressive in comparison to the compound microscopes of hiscontemporaries, which only magnified 20 or 30 times. He was the first to see theinvisible world of microorganisms. And he looked everywhere! In lakes, in drops ofblood, in samples of his own feces, and in plaque taken from his teeth and from the teeth25of two old men who never cleaned their teeth. From this “white matter, which is as thickas if ’twere batter,” he made these observations:“I then most always saw, with great wonder, that in the said matter there were manyvery little living animalcules, very prettily a-moving. The biggest sort . . . had a verystrong and swift motion and shot through the water (or spittle) like a pike does through thewater. . . . The second sort . . . oft-times spun round like a top . . . and these were far morein number.” In the tooth scum from one of the dirty old men, he saw, “an unbelievablygreat company of living animalcules, a-swimming more nimbly than any I had ever seenup to this time. The biggest sort . . . bent their body into curves in going forwards. . . .Moreover, the other animalcules were in such enormous numbers, that all the water . . .seemed to be alive.”These sorts of observations didn’t lead to an understanding of the role bacteria orother microorganisms play for a good many years. Most people assumed that the strangeorganisms that they found in the soil were harmful to plants. But in the late 1800s,scientists began looking a little closer. A group of German foresters eager to grow trufflespersuaded German botanist Albert Bernhard Frank to study the woods and to help themfigure out how to propagate the delicacy. As Frank dug up the forest soil, he discoveredthe silky cocoons of fungal hyphae near the roots of the trees. Some of these hyphae areonly 1⁄60 the size of the plant roots; they lace together healthy soil—in a cubic foot, therecan be 320 miles of hyphae—even if we don’t notice them. Frank observed that the treesgrowing from the tangle of hyphae were healthy, and he began to suspect that the fungiwere helping plants, not attacking them. He conducted an experiment in which he plantedseeds in forest soil, some of which had been sterilized. The seeds in the sterile soil didpoorly versus the natural forest soil that was rich in fungi and other organisms.Although Frank’s conclusions weren’t universally embraced, other researchers wentoff to study soils throughout the world to see how widespread mycorrhizal fungi were.They found them everywhere, from the tropics to alpine regions, but not, significantly, insoils that humans had disrupted, like mines or other areas where the topsoil had beenstripped away.Scientists went on describing and defining soil microorganisms, but no one spentmuch time figuring out why they were there. It’s possible they had a hard time findingfunders for research into something you can’t see and that most people fail to muster theproper enthusiasm for. It’s also hard to conduct this research. Science typically pulls onepiece out of a system for study, but the microorganisms in the soil are part of a complexsystem and can’t really be understood in isolation. Some 99 percent of soil organismscan’t be grown in a lab for study—perhaps because they require the in situ relationshipsto survive.Understanding the microbial underworld had to wait until the 1980s, when biologistDave Coleman urged his Natural Resource Ecology Lab (NREL) at Colorado State26University to start trying to figure it out. He hired microbiologist Elaine Ingham as apostdoc, and she began studying the data. Weekly lab meetings went all day as she and theother members of the lab excitedly puzzled out the complex roles and relationships amongthe soil biology—not just bacteria and fungi, but a whole host of other organisms that arebusily at work under our feet.“No one had ever asked why these organisms are all there together,” says Ingham, awoman with a friendly if determined face—she looks as I imagine those few people whostayed on and faced down the hardships of the American Dust Bowl’s black blizzards inthe 1930s might—and an almost inexhaustible enthusiasm for talking about soilorganisms. She asks: “Why are protozoa in the soil? What would be the purpose? Weknow they eat bacteria, but what’s so useful about eating bacteria? How does that help theplant in any way, shape, or form?”The NREL ultimately figured out that it takes a village to nurture a plant. Fromagapanthus to azaleas, begonias to buddleias, cranesbills to coreopsis, throughout theentire botanical pantheon, when you look at a healthy plant you’re seeing the productiveoutput of a busy village down around the roots, making sure it gets everything it needs.And what a fascinating world! As I learned more and more about our own dark sidefrom Ingham and others, I felt dizzy standing on top of all that activity. When I was a kid, Iused to love to lie on my back with my feet propped against the wall and imagine that Iwas in an upside-down world, where I’d walk on the ceilings and step over doorways toget into another room. Learning about life in the soil has been just as topsy-turvy. Most ofus assume that all the action is on the ground, in the air, in the water, and that earth belowthe soil line is inert and lifeless—except, that is, for those plant roots.But it’s alive down there. Plant roots can plunge as far as 200 feet. Even some of thegrasses that we grow in our parks and on our lawns, if they’re healthy, have roots that candescend 15 feet—and every millimeter of those roots is thrumming with microorgasmicbustle. Microorganisms themselves have been found as far as 10 miles down in the soil.Oil companies have to be careful not to contaminate deep pockets of oil with theseorganisms, because they will happily feed on the oil.Ingham’s taxonomy of soil microorganisms includes five main categories: fungi,bacteria, mobile one-celled organisms called protozoa, tiny worms called nematodes, andmicroarthropods, which are related to crustaceans and insects. Along with the soildwellers we can see with our eyes—earthworms, beetles, voles, and the like—theycompose what she calls the soil food web. More complicated and less fragile than a foodchain, these denizens of the underworld are connected to and reliant on one another inmyriad ways—just as we denizens of the overworld are.Gathered nearest the plant roots are the fungi and bacteria, both of which line up likepigs at a trough to get their carbon sugars. They’re so tightly clustered near the roots that27they form an almost impenetrable boundary between the root and soil pathogens that lurknearby, trying to attack it. The barricade is not only a passive one; fungi can actuallythrow their ropelike strands around an interloper—say a root-eating nematode—andstrangle it. The plant is their sugar daddy, after all. It behooves the fungi and bacteria toprotect it.Likewise, it behooves the plant to keep the fungi and bacteria around, well fed, andincreasing in numbers, as they bring the plant nutrients that it can’t get any other way. Bothfungi and bacteria secrete enzymes that liberate minerals from the clay, silt, and sand, aswell as from stones and actual bedrock. Not just potassium, a mineral routinely added tocrops in conventional farming, but also the wide array of other nutrients that the microbesas well as the plant and those that eat it need to flourish. Ingham says that when she was ingrade school, the list of essential nutrients students studied numbered three. The numberhad grown to 12 by the time she was in high school, 18 by the time she was in graduateschool, and it later reached 32. “The list is going to keep growing until we includeeverything on the periodic table,” she says. “Everything’s important. There is a reason foryttrium on this planet! We don’t need much, but we probably need some.”Fungi deposit these minerals—maybe even yttrium—inside the wall of the plant root,but the minerals foraged and eaten by the bacteria require the participation of othermembers of the food web to reach the plant. The plant is finicky about how these mineralsare presented. One could drop minuscule fragments of cobalt or sulfur—both on the longlist of necessary nutrients—near the plant’s roots, but to no avail; these nutrients must tobe mediated by biology for the plant to be able to use them. Only when minerals areswallowed by bacteria, which are then swallowed by a protozoa or nematode ormicroarthropod out hunting near the plant’s roots, then excreted by those larger organismsin the vicinity of the plant’s roots—only then do the minerals assume a chemical form thatthe plant can use. At that point, the roots can absorb the nutrients through simple diffusion.With two exceptions, plants get all the minerals they need from the soil, needing onlymicrobial—not human—intervention. The air is the source for the two other hugelyimportant nutrients. Plants snatch carbon from the air, all on their own. Nitrogen isanother necessary airborne nutrient—our atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen—but plantscan’t remove it from the air by themselves. Again, they need help from a microbialpartner. Legume plants like alfalfa, clover, lupine, peas, beans, and locust trees attract acertain kind of bacterium that converts atmospheric nitrogen to a form that the plants canabsorb. When the legume plant dies and decomposes, its nitrogen reserve disperses in thesoil and becomes available to the entire local plant community.So there are lots of pizza boys down there. Lots of delivery people bringing Thaifood or tamales (like the couple in the neighborhood where I now live in Portland,Oregon, who sell them from coolers on the backseat of their car). It reminds me a little ofthat scene in Porgy and Bess where vendors clog the streets selling strawberries, honey,28and crab. Another analogy: The plant is kind of like a 1950s housewife, waiting for theFuller Brush Man. But not just waiting passively; it summons the bacteria that tote thekind of mineral load the plant needs. Ingham’s analogy is that the plant prepares a widevariety of cookies and cakes with its carbon sugars to lure the bacteria carrying just theright nutrients. The plant can both vary and increase its output of carbon sugars in order tobeckon the necessary partner microorganisms.These partner microorganisms are remarkably different from plant to plant (and evenfrom location to location: in this case, think of the difference between the large felines ofAfrica and those in the United States). Mycorrhizal fungi work with many plants and, infact, can shoot out their hyphae up to 250 yards and connect to different plants at once,sharing their mineral wares within a whole community of flora. But bacteria are moreparticular. Some bacteria, having evolved to eat a particular kind of carbon sugar, willonly cluster around a few kinds of plants. They’re not quite as particular as a creature likethe sand verbena moth, which feeds exclusively on the sand verbena plant and isendangered wherever that plant is in short supply, but they do have a more specializedrole in the underground ecosystem and are critical to the health of certain kinds of plants.This is the reason it’s difficult to restore a degraded habitat: You might be able to replacethe plants that were once there, or at least some of them; likely, the diversity of plants in anatural state is richer than we know. But will all of them grow in degraded soils wheretheir partner microorganisms have been killed off? Unlikely.The soil bacteria are also specialized for certain conditions, which are determinedby factors such as temperature and the moisture level. Even though billions may beclustered around a plant’s root, not all of them are working at the same time. When thetemperature rises, or during droughts and floods, some of them slack off and others pickup the pace.So, the soil microorganisms provide the plant with both food and protection frompredators. Their third critical role is to control the underground flow of water and gasesby building tiny structures in the soil called aggregates.Bacteria form the tiniest aggregates by catching a piece of clay, silt, or sand andanchoring themselves there with carbon-rich glue, which they produce from the plantsugars. They do this initially to keep themselves from being carried away by watermoving through the soil, just as the bacteria around our teeth create glue—scum andplaque—to cement themselves in place. As they glue more particles to themselves—another piece of silt or maybe a decayed bit of plant material—a tiny structure forms,which both protects them from other organisms that want to eat them and creates space forgases and water. Bacteria have many of the same needs that we do: They need to breatheoxygen and expire carbon dioxide. Without the open space in the soil created by thesebillions of awkwardly shaped aggregates, the bacteria would suffocate.Then fungi come along and gather up some of the bacterial aggregates and make their29own lopsided aggregates, hiding their reproductive parts inside to protect them frompredatory microarthropods. In healthy soils, there are trillions of these aggregates piledon top of each other, each creating space for gases and water to pass through slowly. Theaggregates form spaces that cup the water and make it available to all the life in the soil.Instead of thinking you’re on hard, dead matter when you stand on soil, imagine insteadthat you’re standing on something as porous and dynamic as a living coral reef.When I used to dig in my backyard in Cleveland, my shovel often slammed into alayer of clay and remained stuck there in the soil, reverberating from the shock of myeffort. I’d dig the clay up and it was pretty much like what you’d pound and knead in apottery class. That’s an example of soil with few microbial aggregates. Microscopically,clay particles have a rodlike shape. Without microorganisms to jumble up the rods andglue them into three-dimensional snowflakes, the clay particles press tightly against oneanother, forming a barrier for shovels as well as gases and water. That’s why clay is agood water-resistant material for everything from pots to houses. Up to half of the world’speople still live in houses that incorporate clay in the building materials.Here’s another analogy: Imagine the smaller mineral particles like clay and silt assheets of paper. When they’re flat, they form a dense, heavy pile. But if you ball up eachsheet, the same amount of paper occupies a larger and airier space.Soils with a lot of sand have a different problem. The large sand particles don’timpede the flow of water, but there’s so much space between them that they can’t hang onto it, either. In this case, microbial and fungal aggregates become like tiny dams in thesoil, each holding a precious reservoir of water. When there aren’t puddles on the surfaceand obvious signs of moisture, we tend to think that the ground is dry. We call it dry land!But it’s a water world down there beneath the surface. The microorganisms move aroundon the water films between and within the soil aggregates. Even though these organismsleft the sea millions and millions of years ago, they still slip and slide their way throughthe soil on tiny waterways.In fact, healthy soil that’s rich in microorganisms and heavily studded with theiraggregates holds water like a sponge, slowly releasing it to plants as well as to rivers andstreams. Healthy soil is the best protection for crops during a drought, as well as the bestprotection against floods anywhere. The soil is the earth’s first water purification system,too: The microorganisms will attack and purge water of its pollutants, eventually drainingit into a stream or aquifer in a pure form.People who extol the value of these healthy soils talk about these benefits—thedrought protection, the flood prevention, the purification of water—as ecosystemservices. As if growing healthy food isn’t important enough by itself! They’ve beenadding another ecosystem service to the list in recent years, as fears about globalwarming mount: carbon sequestration.30We tend to think of the “greenhouse effect” as being a modern obsession, butscientists have been puzzling over the factors that control earth’s temperature forcenturies. French scientist Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier noted in the early 1800s that thetemperature of earth “should be a little below what would be observed in the polarregions,” since it seems that the heat we receive from the sun should escape into space.Based on his studies, he suggested that our atmosphere provides an insulating blanketwhich keeps us warm. Later that century, John Tyndall conducted experiments at the RoyalInstitution of Great Britain showing that various atmospheric gases—including watervapor and carbon dioxide, now known to be the two most significant greenhouse gases—could absorb and emit enough radiant heat to control the planet’s temperature. In 1896,Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius published a paper showing that changing atmosphericconcentrations of carbon dioxide might explain earth’s cycle of ice ages and temperateperiods, and noted that humans might have an influence on this concentration through theburning of coal. British engineer Guy Stewart Callendar built upon this idea in 1938,pointing out the links among fossil fuel combustion, rising CO2 levels, and rises in worldtemperature.Even if the burning of fossil fuels wafted more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,most scientists assumed the seas would absorb this excess. But in 1959, Swedishscientists Bert Bolin and Erik Eriksson published a paper showing that while CO2 wasabsorbed in the upper layer of the ocean, most of it drifted back into the atmospherebefore sinking safely into deep water. In 1958, Harry Wexler, chief of scientific servicesat the U.S. Weather Bureau secured funding for a permanent station at the Mauna LoaObservatory in Hawaii to monitor the gas and tapped a young research chemist namedCharles Keeling for the job. Keeling had discovered an accurate way to measureatmospheric carbon dioxide and pegged it at 310 parts per million. By the time he died in2005, the reading had risen to 380 parts per million. By 2013, the count was 400 ppm.Even if we miraculously stopped using fossil fuels right now—and we have so farlacked the courage and vision to make meaningful progress—we would still have thisshroud of carbon dioxide hanging over our heads. This legacy load, as it’s called, wouldeventually dissipate, but over thousands of years—not soon enough to save the planetfrom rapid warming. A handful of scientists and entrepreneurs have geeked-out plans toremove this legacy load from the skies, but—at least so far—their ideas either havefrightening caveats attached or are so costly that they’d never get funding.But we are already living within a massive biological machine that can tackle thelegacy load. Nothing that we think of as our world would exist without this machine.We’ve been unwittingly hampering its work for millennia—more on that in the nextchapter—but beyond the reach of our eyes and ears, it is always at work, removingcarbon dioxide from the air and converting it to a precious resource. And this machinedoes its work for free.31When the fungi and bacteria gobble up the carbon sugars inside or near the plant root,the carbon doesn’t just disappear. It becomes part of their bodies. Fungal hyphae snakethat carbon throughout the soil as if they were railroad tracks; when they die, that farreachingnetwork of carbon stays in the soil to be nibbled at by other creatures. Whenother microorganisms eat the fungi and bacteria, they incorporate the carbon into theirown bodies. Even digestion leaves deposits of carbon studded throughout the soil whenthe fungi and bacteria excrete carbon sugars in their waste, and still smaller creaturessnatch it up and eat it. The carbon keeps cycling through the soil food web, and each timeit’s eaten and excreted it emerges in a more concentrated form. The process ofdecomposition is one in which the soil organisms keep creating longer and morecomplicated carbon chains. Thus, the carbon sugars in the simple syrup that the plantcreated from sunlight ultimately is bound into a chain with maybe 10,000 other carbonatoms, which are themselves linked to hydrogen, oxygen, and other nutrients. As thecarbon chains grow bigger, all that carbon keeps making the soil darker.The word for these carbon chains? “Organic.” It’s a word that’s become very fuzzyas marketers have applied it to everything from peaches to frozen pizza to cosmetics. Forhundreds of years, soil chemists used the word “organic” to refer to compounds withcarbon chains, all of which contain the energy that plants create from sunlight. The wordonly became a synonym for healthful and natural food when Jerome Irving Rodale—thefounder of the Rodale Institute—applied it in the 1940s to the kinds of nutritious food hesought for better health. He was convinced that only the agriculture that worked withnature to create these carbon-rich soils could produce good food.As one soil organism after another eats the carbon sugars and poops them out, thecarbon chains become more recalcitrant—meaning, they’re more and more difficult tobreak down further. At the end of the process emerges what’s called humin, which is justcarbon, hydrogen, and a little oxygen. There’s almost nothing left to eat there, and thatcarbon can be locked into the soil for centuries. But when soil scientists talk about soilorganic matter or humus, they’re not just talking about humin. And they’re not referring tothe bags of stuff sold at the garden center. “Soil organic matter is not just one thing,” saysKristine Nichols, a soil microbiologist with the USDA’s Northern Great Plains ResearchLaboratory in North Dakota. “It’s thousands to millions of things. It’s the simple sugars,it’s the bacterial cells, it’s the waste produced by the bacteria and fungi and otherorganisms. What we call ‘humus’ is a broad spectrum of molecules.”Soil microorganisms breathe, just as we do, and they exhale carbon dioxide. Of allthe carbon that goes into the soil—from the carbon sugars and the plant debris and fromall the microorganisms that decompose both—only a tiny percentage is locked semipermanentlyinto the soil as humin. Nichols suggests that it could be as low as 1 to 10percent. Still, it will remain in the soil for decades or centuries—even millennia—instead of cycling back into the atmosphere in months.32So back to Rattan Lal’s idea that we can reverse global warming by locking carboninto the soil this way. Wouldn’t we have to put an immense amount of carbon into the soilfor that 1 to 10 percent to make much of a dent on the legacy load of greenhouse gases inthe atmosphere?How is that possible, when everything humans have done to the land in the last10,000 years has stripped carbon from the soil and slowed the process of putting it there?# Chapter 3: Send In the Cows
Acow with horns like a wide unstrung bow waved a sharp tip at a black-faced goatthat had darted in front of her to grab a mouthful of grass. As if in a huff, she thenswung her big gray head to the east and began to strut away from the herd, drawing a lineof cows behind her.Quickly, Soka stopped our conversation and jogged ahead of the breakaway bovines.He didn’t wave a stick or throw stones or even shout, as herders often do. This wedge ofherbivores—500 cows plus 700 sheep and goats—is managed differently from any in thispart of Zimbabwe, differently even from how Soka’s great-great-great-great-greatgrandfatherwould have managed a herd. Creature-to-creature courtesy prevails. Wavingsticks and shouting would stress the animals and make them less likely to flourish. SoSoka just stood in front of the wayward cows, arms akimbo, his heavy jumpsuit a leancolumn of green in the golden winter landscape of southern Africa. The cows stopped infront of him and masticated thoughtfully, their dark eyes fixed upon him, then ambled backto the herd.Soka knelt again and bent back the grass, some of it so dry that it snapped noisily.“We move and move and move the herd,” he said with his commendable accumulation ofEnglish words. “They eat and eat, but not too much.”I nodded.He spun around and pointed to a naked patch of ground behind him, so hard and drythat its surface was as smooth as a dusty clay pot. The cows had missed this piece. “Whenwater falls here, it goes whoosh!” He flung his arms out at the surrounding savanna, hisface a picture of feigned distress at the thought of that water running off the surface. Thenhe pointed to an area that the herd had passed over, nudged along with hisses by him andthe other herders. Some of the grass had been eaten and the rest was trampled to theground. Piles of manure steamed between the stalks. In the bits of bare ground betweenthe tufts of grass, the animals’ hooves had gouged little half-moon dents in the soil. Sokasmiled. “Here, water goes down and down. Land heals.”I already knew most of this in theory, but enjoyed the tutorial from someone whoevery day put to the test Allan Savory’s approach to healing the land. Later that evening,when I was back at the Africa Centre for Holistic Management near Victoria Falls, sittingat a table with people who were there either to learn or to teach the Savory method, Iturned to Savory himself and told him about Soka’s attempt to enlighten me.34Savory laughed and fingered his short white beard. “I brought Zimbabwe’s ministerof water out here and set him up under a tree near one of the pools of water in the savannato talk to one of our senior herders,” he said. “It was interesting to see this educatedminister being schooled by a totally illiterate herder, who was telling him in his ownlanguage that it was the hooves of the cattle that had produced this pool of water. Hefinally convinced him. We’ll start healing the rivers of this country if we ever havenormal political times here.”In all the discussions of agriculture and land use, it may be hard to find anyone ascontroversial and iconoclastic as Savory. So much so that I was actually taken aback byhis physical appearance when I first met him. He’s a slight man, and I was expecting agiant. I had arrived at the center 2 days before I went walking with the herders, after I’dspent a frustrating 3 hours at the Victoria Falls airport. Another foreigner named Kris wasarriving later that afternoon, and this had so confused things at the center that no one waswaiting for me. A savvy traveler friend back in the United States had warned me not totell the Zimbabwean airport officials that I was a journalist—“They might make troublefor you”—but as planeload after planeload of tourists arrived and paraded away withtour operators, I had started to wonder if dictator Robert Mugabe’s men had guessed mysecret.Someone from the center finally arrived and installed me in a small dormitory builtfor visiting students, where it was so cozy and dark that I was tempted to stay inside andcatch up on some sleep. But I was in Africa for the first time in my life—Africa!—andhad to explore, even though my driver told me that Savory couldn’t meet me for a fewhours. I put on my straw hat and set off down one of the dirt paths leading away from thecenter, stopping when the driver shouted after me. “Don’t go too far!” he said. “We are inthe jungle, and there are animals all around.”“Which ones?”He held up four fingers. “All of the Big Five except rhinos. Elephants, lions,leopards, and buffalo.”So I wandered close to the center for a while, admiring the elegant local architecture.There were two large buildings called rondavels at the center of the campus, one a diningroom and one a classroom. The walls were built of local stone set into a daub made from—Savory later told me—soil that termites mix with their own saliva, taken from the hugeconed nests out in the savanna. Each building shouldered a high, gracefully thatched roofmade from grasses harvested nearby that had weathered to silver and were cut in scallopsalong the bottom, with another decorative cap of grasses at the very top. Then I wanderedslightly farther, past another rondavel under construction, its thatched roof still golden. Ilearned later that lions sometimes lurk near the under-construction rondavel, that I mighthave wandered a bit too far.35I finally settled at a thatched patio with a few of the center’s other guests. Thesunlight had started its afternoon slant and we were musing about wine, which the centersold on an honor system from the refrigerator in the dining room. Then a coupleapproached the table. I recognized Savory’s beautiful wife, Jody Butterfield, from herphoto on the jacket of their book, Holistic Management: A New Framework for DecisionMaking, then realized that the man with her had to be Savory himself. He carried a longwalking stick, and my quick impression was of a desert patriarch in khakis. Whileeveryone else had their legs covered, he wore shorts, which exposed thin brown legs andshoe-less feet. I had felt the sharp prickling of the dried grasses around the center eventhrough my sneakers, and I asked about his bare feet.“I read the land with my feet,” he said with an amused smile. “When I’m in NewMexico (he and Butterfield live half of each year in the States), I run barefoot on gravel tokeep my feet from getting soft.” He told me that his wife sometimes hears weirdscratching sounds when he gets into bed at night, which usually turn out to be caused bythorns stuck in his feet snagging the sheets. He doesn’t feel them.Savory was born in 1936 into an Africa that he still pines for—an Africa where hecould hear drumming at night and large animals crashing through the bush. Zimbabwe wasstill Southern Rhodesia then, a British colony dominated by whites and named after theSouth African politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes. But during his youth, Savory wasless interested in the country’s politics than in its wild places. His father was a civilengineer who often had to careen into the wilderness to inspect dams or other projects.His uncle had a ranch where the young Savory spent as much time as possible, ridinghorses and hunting. Savory kept up with these passions even when he was sent to aboarding school called Plumtree, which was a feeder school for Britain’s Royal MilitaryAcademy. Savory was fascinated by war—World War II raged during much of his youth—but still, he was a tough fit for the school. In defiance of rules, he brought his guns andsneaked out to hunt as often as he could, taking his catches to a nearby village to becooked and shared. “I was very irreverent,” he told me. “I kept my ammo in a hollowedout Bible on my bookcase. I knew no one would look for it there.”Savory was no less scrappy in college, but the difference between him and theacademic environment was now more philosophical. He majored in botany and zoology,and his teachers constantly chided him because he’d raise questions about animals in hisplant classes and plants in his animal classes. For his part, he couldn’t understand howone could have a meaningful discussion of plants while excluding the impact that animallife had on them. Likewise, how could one understand animals without knowledge of theflora that made up the floor, walls, and often the ceilings of their world? “I couldn’t get adiscussion going about both at the same time,” he said. “I was very discouraged with thecompartmentalization of academic life.”He was also dismayed by what he saw as ignorance among his lecturers and had no36problem challenging them. When one visiting lecturer told a class that crocodiles haveflaps behind their ears and the musculature to move them but never did, Savory pointedout that his pet crocs—he not only had them at the university but even later, when he wasin the Rhodesian army—agitated their flaps when he angered them. And Savory wasirritated when scientists spoke of experiments done in laboratories with plants dug upfrom the wild. “The moment you dig it up and remove it from its environment, it’s adifferent plant,” he told me.As soon as Savory finished college, he skipped all the graduation festivities andheaded back into his beloved bush. At the age of 20, he became a research biologist andgame warden for the Northern Rhodesian Game and Tsetse Control Department, in theregion that is now the nation of Zambia.Quickly, he said, “I began to realize that all I loved was doomed.” Rapiddesertification encroached upon the vast grassland savannas and threatened the habitat ofthe animals he was hired to protect; their numbers were thinning. Like everyone else thenand now, Savory assumed that the land was degrading because too many cattle were alsograzing the savannas. “I’m told you can go back to ancient Hebrew texts and see themblaming the nomads for causing the desert with their animals,” he told me.And it is certainly true that long-ago humans were hard on their environments. Manyof us have dewy-eyed notions that people living before the 200 years of the modernindustrial era lived in harmony with the land and left a lighter footprint than we do.However, research shows over and over that this was not the case. Their cumulativeeffect was lighter than ours because there were relatively few of them, but “their personalfootprint per person as measured by the land use metric was actually much higher” saysscientist William Ruddiman, PhD, author of Plows, Plagues and Petroleum: HowHumans Took Control of Climate.True, premodern people weren’t driving cars and tearing the tops off of mountains tomine coal for electric power, but they burned forests to create pastureland and cropland,and they ripped open the soil with increasingly damaging plows to plant their crops. Theydidn’t pave paradise, but there was so much of it that they could afford to ruin one plot ofground and just move on to the next green space. Of the total global deforestation that’staken place over the millennia, 75 percent occurred before 1850.Humans began to affect climate with their carbon-releasing activities long before themodern era. Normally, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere fluctuate. Ice cores show thatinterglaciations, or ice ages, driven by a natural drop in greenhouse gases, occur roughlyevery 10,000 years. But the onset of human agriculture 10,000 years ago began to addnew amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Archaeological data shows thatpopulations exploded and deforestation became rampant in Europe and China about 8,000years ago, with an attendant belching of greenhouse gases—not just carbon wafting upfrom burning forests and degraded soils, but also methane from wetlands, irrigated rice37fields, and livestock. Ruddiman theorizes that early humans increased greenhouse gasesso much that we avoided an ice age that should have arrived perhaps 2,000 years ago.Without human activity over the ages, our atmosphere would contain about 245 parts permillion, instead of the 400 ppm reached in 2013.Early humans were so hard on the land that they created huge deserts in areas wherehumans have lived the longest, Savory says. These include the Sahara, a China-size desertin northern Africa, and the Tihama in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Savory likes to point outthat in the 5th century BC, Herodotus described Libya as having rich soils and anabundance of springs to feed its large population. Now, Libya is largely desert.Much of the blame for desertification has been placed on pastoralists and theiranimals. Savory had no fondness for cattle or ranchers early in his career, and famouslysaid in an oft-quoted remark, “Let’s shoot every damn cow and bloody rancher that standsin the way” of the effort to reverse desertification.Still, he spent a lot of time in the bush and what he was seeing there didn’t alwaysjibe with the cow-hating dogma. Ranchers stopped grazing their cattle in areas where thetsetse fly was rampant, but even in these wild swatches—where the elephants and zebrasand big cats roamed without competition from cattle—the land continued to degrade.Game wardens typically set fire to the ranges to get rid of the old dried grasses—andindeed, there would soon be a flush of green among the blackened stubble—but eventhough the other scientists believed that fire would bring fresh grasses and the game back,Savory noticed that it increased the patches of bare ground between the plants. “It wastrue that herders had been degrading the land thousands of years,” he said. “But a centuryof modern land management was just intensifying the degradation.”Range management thinking, then and now, held that degraded land would heal itselfif the animals were removed and the land were allowed to rest. But over and over,Savory saw that rest did not heal his savannas. For instance, Zimbabwe’s method ofbattling tsetse fly outbreaks was to kill all the game animals over large areas with theintention of removing the flies’ blood meals and starving them. The practice reduced thetsetse fly outbreaks, but Savory noted that the land did not heal during these periods oftime when all the animals were gone. Instead, it grew ever more degraded.In yet another area—a game reserve called the Tuli Circle, near the Botswana border—Savory and other wildlife biologists saw the number of animals wax and then wanedramatically as overpopulation triggered mass starvation. They expected to see the landrecover, but again it continued to deteriorate, even with fewer animals. Many of the otherscientists blamed drought, but Savory noted in a research paper that they’d actually had ahigh-volume rainy season that year. He concluded that once land passes a certain point ofdegradation, it cannot heal—a conclusion he now believes is utterly wrong.He continued to believe that drought and too many cattle caused desertification until38he visited northern Europe for the first time. He observed Scottish lands that had beenharshly overgrazed but then healed when rested. Even areas with low annual precipitationwere able to heal. In fact, this is what I found in my backyard in Cleveland every timesomeone dug it up trying to fix the drainage problem that kept flooding my garage: If Ididn’t plant something, nature would quickly raise a bountiful and vibrant crop of weedson the exposed soil.How could prolonged rest heal lands in northern Europe and in the eastern UnitedStates but make the Rhodesian savannas more degraded? Savory finally realized thatthese environments were vastly different on what he came to call the brittleness scale,meaning whether the vegetation routinely dried out so much that it would snap in yourhand. My backyard in Cleveland was right up against the far end of the non-brittle scale,because we had steady precipitation—either rain or snow—throughout the year. When Ifirst moved to the eastern United States from my arid stretch of the Sacramento Valley, themoisture and especially the humidity were a shock. At first, I felt almost claustrophobic,as if I were imprisoned in a steam bath.Unlike Cleveland and northern Europe, much of southern Africa has rainy seasonsfollowed by long dry seasons. Savory surmised that the annual amount of precipitationwasn’t the key factor in whether the land could heal all on its own, with rest; instead, thedistribution of moisture throughout the year was critical. Bare land just can’t heal whenit’s all dried out. It even develops a hard surface—like the bare clay-pot patch that Sokapointed out to me—that actually repels water. The vegetation in these brittle areas diesbut does not decompose, which is a biological process carried out by microorganisms.These microorganisms die or go dormant when the rains stop. During these long dryperiods, the vegetation instead undergoes a chemical process in which it oxidizes or justweathers and takes a long time to break down. The evidence for that had been in front ofme on my first day at the center: the thatched roofs on the rondavels that had turned grayand could remain rigid and unyielding to the elements for decades. When left on thesavannas, these dry grasses become a tough, durable screen that keeps the sunlight fromreaching the soil and stimulating the growth of new plants when the rain returns.But Africa’s savannas had been rich environments for wildlife in the distant past. Ifthey hadn’t been able to heal themselves from fire, occasional overpopulation, and otherdisasters, what had healed them? Savory’s earliest conceptualization of nature—that therewas a complex interplay between plants and animals and soil that science erroneouslypicked apart—carried him toward new thinking. He guessed that pastoralists over themillennia were unwittingly subverting some natural process that had healed thegrasslands, and so they were causing it to degrade.Savory’s musings about the savannas were interrupted when Rhodesia erupted incivil war in the 1960s, as various black guerilla groups fought against the racist Ian Smithgovernment. Savory was called into active duty in the Rhodesian army, and, given his39experience in the bush, he was put in charge of a tracker combat unit that followed themovements of the guerillas. Where he had once observed the land closely to trackproblem animals or poachers, his observation skills now sharpened considerably, as hisown and his comrades’ lives depended on his ability to read the land. “I was observingthe ground at the level that scientists usually don’t,” he told me. “You’re going to get shotif you miss a bent blade of grass. At night, you’re lying in the bush and you can’t light afire, because you’re fighting a war. You’ve got all night to think, because you don’t sleepvery well.”Savory adopted the practice of walking barefoot through the bush then, not onlybecause it made him more aware of the ground beneath his feet, but also because he didn’twant to give his unit’s movement away to barefoot guerillas who could easily pick up theimprint of a boot. All the men in his unit went barefoot too.In the course of tracking the guerillas, Savory and his unit passed over wildgrasslands where animals behaved as they had for millions of years, as well as throughgame reserves, farms, and ranches. He quickly found that the hardest places to pick up thetrack were areas where there were lots of herding animals behaving as they had beforehumans interfered with nature; there, the grass was lush and growing. In areas wherepeople were managing the animals, whether cattle on ranches or elephants in gamereserves where they were protected from predators, the land was poor and the grasssparse. Savory realized that animals in their natural state had a positive effect on brittlelandscapes. In fact, it seemed that either removing them from the land or changing theirancient behaviors caused the degradation.In the past, the savannas had been home to vast herds of grazing animals such asantelopes, buffalo, elephants, zebras, and many more. What was so very different aboutthe behaviors of these herds? Savory recalled his observations of the many herds of wildelephants he’d tracked over the years. When they slowed down to eat in the grasslands,they spread out slightly, but not very far, because they were afraid of the lions, hyenas,and other predators that hunted them in packs. As they fed, they dropped dung andnitrogen-rich urine on the ground, feeding both the plants and the microorganisms in thesoil. When they moved on as a herd, they stayed close together—again, to avoid gettingpicked off by packs of predators that didn’t dare approach a herd—and trampled all thevegetation in their path. Savory realized that this trampling actually benefitted the soil.Grasses don’t shed their leaves as many other plants do, and the trampling forced bothliving plant material and dead grass onto the soil surface—the dead grasses didn’t get achance to oxidize, weather, and block sunlight from seedlings. This plant “litter”protected the soil from erosion, shielded soil moisture from evaporation, and fed the soilorganisms. The animals’ hooves also beat up the surface of the bare soil, allowing it totake in seeds and moisture, in a manner very similar to the way gardeners break up thesoil surface to prepare a flower bed. Humans unintentionally changed the way the herdsimpacted the grasslands when they domesticated them. The herds no longer needed to40clump tightly together and keep moving to protect themselves from predators; there werenow fences and vigilant herders to protect them. The animals became sedentary andspread out over the landscape, becoming the picture-postcard bucolic scene that we solove today. Savory realized that the land degraded because most people didn’t understandthe vital connection between plants, animals, and soil.A trip to North America further convinced Savory that animal impact could heal theland. He visited arid national parks where cattle had been kept away for decades andwhere there were so few wild animals that there was literally no animal impact. Thoselands continued to degrade, so much so that some people concluded that they were meantto be that way.Savory doesn’t claim that he was the first to notice the connection between largenumbers of herding animals and soil health—folk wisdom from various countries heldthat animals could improve the land with their hooves. He recalled old ranchers tellinghim that one had to “hammer veldt to sweeten it”—meaning, to pound the land withhooves. So he was sure animal impact was needed to heal the land, but what kind ofimpact?When white settlers arrived, the savannas had been bountiful with vast herds ofbuffalo, antelope, zebras, and the like that far outnumbered the domestic herds that arrivedlater. Savory began to wonder if the problem was not the number of animals on the land,but rather the amount of time they spent there. Again, conventional thinking held thatanimal impact was bad, so no one had thought of conducting such heretical research. Hetried doing his own research by lobbing paint bombs at wild elephants to distinguish oneherd from another so that he could measure exactly how long they stayed in an area beforelumbering off together. This proved an impossible task, and he couldn’t round up anyoneelse to help him.Then Savory heard about a savvy botanist and farmer in South Africa named JohnAcocks who claimed to be grazing cattle in such a way that they made the land healthyinstead of ruining it, so he flew down to meet him. Acocks explained that if cattle wereturned loose in a large field to graze wherever they wanted, they would pick their favoritegrass and graze it down to the ground, then move on to their next favorite and graze itdown to the ground, and so on. The prevailing wisdom at the time held that this was anessentially good practice, as it allowed the cattle to select the nutrients they needed. ButAcocks knew that this was a surefire way to ruin the land, because the cattle wouldovergraze the desirable grass types until their roots died and the land became bare.Instead, he confined his cattle to small areas so that they would graze the plants evenlyand not too much, then moved them to another small field to begin again. Savory examinedAcocks’s field with great interest, noting how the cattle trampled plant matter into thesoil, how their hooves had pocked the surface so that water seeped in instead of runningoff, how new plants were growing around the roots of the old ones. He saw that it might41be possible to manage domestic cattle so that they replicated the salutary effect of wildherding animals. The amount of time they grazed the land seemed to be a critical factor.Back in Rhodesia again, Savory consulted a book that had been sitting on a shelf,ignored, for years. French scientist André Voisin’s findings were widely published 60years ago but largely ignored in Africa, Australia, and the United States, which hold greatsway in international range management science. Savory himself had never been terriblyinterested in the man’s work, as he assumed that insights from fecund France wouldn’thave much bearing on the dry African savannas.But in Grass Productivity, Voisin explained that overgrazing was determined not bythe number of animals on a plot of land, but on how long they stayed there. Acocks hadn’tlet his cattle stay in a pasture long enough to eat the grass down to the soil line, and hedidn’t return them to the pasture until the grass had recovered. This not only kept the landfrom turning into desert but actually improved the grasses and soil. When cattle or othergrazers bite and pull at the grass, the plants struggle to regrow their leaves. They suckcarbon sugars back up from their roots and root hairs, causing some of them to die andleave behind a web of carbon to decompose in the soil. As the grasses rebuild their stalksand leaves, they ramp up their production of carbon sugars again, shooting some backdown to their root system for new growth. “When you graze and then let the plantsrecover, they pulse carbon and moisture into the soil,” Savory explained. “Trees don’t dothe same thing. That’s why grasslands are so important to carbon cycling.”Acocks had come close to having his cattle replicate the grazing patterns of ancientherds. Because these herds bunched tightly together to protect themselves from predators,they quickly covered a small area—similar to the size of Acocks’s pastures—with urineand dung. No animal wants to feed on its own waste, so the herd kept lumbering forwardinstead of overgrazing that same piece of ground. When they reached a new stretch ofland, they’d graze for a nutritionally balanced diet, eating some plants and leaving others,but generally leaving the land in good condition with their hoofprints, dung, and nitrogenrichurine. By the time their dung had decomposed and they were ready to return to theland, it would have regenerated. Years and years of this behavior created carbon-rich soilfilled with aggregates that allowed rainfall to quickly penetrate the soil and remain there,even through the dry periods. Savory calls this “effective rainfall,” meaning that itpercolates deeply into the soil and nourishes a wide range of living things over a longperiod of time. The rain doesn’t run off and erode the soil, as it does in degradedlandscapes, where there can be floods right after a heavy rain because the land can’tabsorb the water and then, the following week, parched soil and drought. If there isn’teffective rainfall, Savory argues, then total rainfall doesn’t matter much.By the mid-1960s, Savory flipped his political alliances; instead of tracking blackguerillas, he was now the leading voice of white opposition in parliament to the racist IanSmith government. His interest in politics had stemmed initially from his conviction that42environmentalists needed to get into politics. But just as he didn’t believe in separatingthe science of plants from the science of animals, he couldn’t separate what washappening on the land from the fate of people who lived on the land. “I wore many hats atthat time,” Savory told me. “But whatever hat I was wearing, I was always interested inpoor land leading to the loss of wildlife, to poverty and violence, to the abuse of womenand children, to political upheaval. In my mind, it was always the same thing.”He had also come to the conclusion that professional range managers were doingmore harm than good to the land. He had battled the practice of controlled burns fromwithin the Northern Rhodesian game department, arguing against the common belief thatwildfires had created the wide, grassy savannas and pointing instead to the innumerablemigrating animals that coevolved with the grasses. He argued that even if the burnscreated new growth in adult plants, they suppressed the number of new plants and createdwider and wider spaces between the vegetation. Such loss of biomass, whether caused byfire or overgrazing, was difficult to reverse and he declared it the beginning of theprocess leading to desertification. He tried to publish scientific papers on the subject, butcouldn’t get them through the peer-review process. He proposed putting together acommittee of young, bright scientists who would travel the world for a few years to seehow people in other countries were managing their grasslands. Then he quit his job at thegame department, convinced that it was just too hard to get people to listen to an argumentthat ran counter to everything they had ever learned. He no longer wanted to be a scientistemployed by others, as he felt that bureaucracies and their dogmas hampered creativethinking. He became an independent researcher and consultant with a raft of clients, aswell as a rancher himself.Despite Savory’s iconoclasm and occasional pariah status—or maybe because of it—farmers and ranchers began to ask for his help. One day an old ranching couple turnedup at his front door. They had been following the advice of all the other experts, and theycould see that their land was still deteriorating. Even Savory’s infamous statement aboutwanting to shoot the bloody cows and ranchers that he once thought were causingdesertification hadn’t deterred them. “I told them that I didn’t know they loved their landas much as I did,” Savory told me. “I said, ‘I’ll help you, provided you understand that Ihave no answers for you. We’ll have to work together and see what we can find out.’ ”Even highly successful ranchers sought his perspective. Rhodesia’s conservationservice gave an award every year for the best-managed veldt, and one of the winnerscontacted Savory to ask, “Is my land as good as the authorities say it is?” Savory askedthe man’s land manager to take him to the best area on the property and leave him for afew hours. “It was a sea of grass waving in the wind,” Savory recalled. “It lookedbeautiful. It had rightly won the trophy.”But Savory dropped to the ground to do his observations, just as he had when he wastracking guerillas during the war. This time, he was measuring the bare space between43individual grass plants. The other experts at the time measured desertification by theland’s overall loss of productivity, but Savory’s definition was becoming more nuanced.His included lack of biomass, which he found in the bare ground between plants. He alsofound that the roots of the mature plants were sticking a half inch into the air. “Obviously,they don’t grow into the air,” Savory said. “The rancher had lost a half inch of soilbecause of erosion between the plants.”Savory’s verdict? That the prizewinning land was up to 90 percent desertified.Alarmed, the rancher contracted with Savory to help him change the managementpractices on his land.Over the years, Savory developed an approach for healing the land that is nowknown as holistic planned grazing. It departs from all other land management strategies inthat the process begins by asking farmers and ranchers to describe the lives they want tolead based on their deepest cultural, spiritual, and material values and to identify ways ofworking on the land that would support these lives for thousands of years. (In case thissounds excruciatingly earnest, a holistic management trainer who was visiting the centershowed me photos of Masai warriors wearing not much more than their beads undergoinghis training; it made as much sense to them as it makes to hip urban permaculturists whereI now live in Portlandia.) Savory first encountered this kind of holistic framework whenhe studied the work of Jan Smuts, a South African lawyer, botanist, soldier, and two-timeprime minister of South Africa. Later praised by Albert Einstein as having ideated theother of the two concepts—including his own theory of relativity—that would beimportant to the future of humanity, Smuts believed that nature functions in wholes andpatterns, that it is a complicated system that humans erroneously approach as a complexmachine. When we interact with nature mechanistically and assume we need only removeor change one cog to fix a problem, we are bound to incur unintended consequences thatare often worse than the problem.An example: Savory likes to point out that many millions of dollars are spent tryingto eradicate noxious weeds with sprays and culling. But people engaged in these battlesagainst nature don’t understand that they’re battling a symptom of the loss of biodiversityin the landscape. “Leaders in Montana spent over $50 million trying to kill knapweed,”Savory told a reporter from Range magazine in 1999. “They may as well proclaim it thestate flower because there are now more than ever.”Our ignorance about the holistic nature of our environment is best expressed, Savorysaid in remarks at the 2012 annual congress of the Grassland Society of Southern Africa,by the way we approach our most pressing environmental problems. “The three greatissues of the day are biodiversity loss, desertification, and climate change,” he said.“Each is being addressed separately by different institutions and even within suchinstitutions—universities, environmental organizations, governments and internationalagencies, and in separate international conferences. Yet they are one and the same44inseparable issue.”Savory’s holistic management process takes many variables into account. To managean ecosystem (Savory says the process can be used to manage anything, from a family to asmall business), decision makers look at the array of tools people have traditionally usedto manage the land. Savory lists three that are typically used to manage large landscapes:fire, technology (from plowing to spraying chemicals), and rest (from roping offparklands for decades to crop rotation). Instead of these tools, which can never healbrittle lands, he proposes grazing and animal impact—careful grazing in which domesticanimals are moved through a landscape as a proxy for the ancient herds that helped buildthe grasslands in the first place.I heard much of Savory’s story during long interviews around a fire pit in the clusterof thatch and stone buildings where he and Butterfield live during their trips toZimbabwe. Savory kept a pair of binoculars by his side and peered occasionally atanimals moving through the brush. Monkeys peered back at us, a couple of baboons lopedby and gawked, and elephants had come calling one night and the ground was littered withbranches that they’d pulled from the trees. Savory told me that they have to be careful oflions if they get up in the middle of the night. A warthog came into his hut while he wasnapping one day and gored him, but that wasn’t a wild animal attack—until that day, thewarthog had been a camp pet. Savory doesn’t do anything to remove the dangerousanimals unless one becomes a prolonged nuisance. He respects the role of predators inkeeping the wild herds wild so that they bunch and travel and heal the land. Sedentaryelephants are as bad as sedentary cows. In fact, Savory is an enthusiastic predatorhimself. After my last interview, he shared one of his favorite game dishes with me:smoked elephant trunk from his freezer. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it if it had beenthoroughly thawed, or maybe my taste buds were held too firmly in the grip of myfondness for Dojiwe, the young orphan elephant that was the new camp pet. Her namemeans “lost and found.”Savory has many speaking engagements around the world, but many people visit himin Zimbabwe—scientists, cattlemen, politicians, filmmakers, journalists,environmentalists, and more—and many sit right where I was, near the fire pit, with thebaboons and other animals looking on. When I visited, the center staff was still excitedthat Savory had won the 2010 Buckminster Fuller Challenge, which targets solutions tobig global problems. They were stoked at the possibility of securing an even biggerhonor: The center is a finalist for billionaire Sir Richard Branson’s $25 million awardfor the best plan for removing carbon dioxide from the air. Shortly after I returned to theStates, a video of Prince Charles expressing his interest in Savory’s work wascirculating.“I believe this is the first real breakthrough in thousands of years,” Savory told me.“When you get a breakthrough of this magnitude, you never make it on your own. I was45building on my own mistakes, building on the mistakes of others. We can learn from ourmistakes if we’re open.”I imagine that comments like that, as well as Savory’s repeated statements about theuselessness of conventional rangeland science, continue to rankle many in mainstream andacademic science. Others are more accepting, but still feel that Savory’s methods havenot been adequately proved by well-controlled studies. In November 2012, a groupcalled Managing Change Northwest invited Savory to speak to the WashingtonCattlemen’s Association, the Tilth Producers of Washington, and the Seattle public. ChadKruger, director of Washington State University’s Center for Sustaining Agriculture andNatural Resources (CSANR), helped organize the event, then posted his reflections aboutSavory online. He noted that some critics have concluded that the science supportingSavory’s approach “is either anecdotal or statistically inconclusive because theexperiments were poorly designed (they didn’t isolate single variables for analysis). . . .While I don’t think that critiques are necessarily a definite dismissal of the legitimacy ofHM [Savory’s holistic management system], I do think they raise an extremely validquestion . . . ‘Where’s the data?’ ”Savory responded online, “Your struggle to understand is natural in a paradigmshifting situation. . . . It took me many years because I too was blinded by my reductionistuniversity education.” He referred Kruger to a number of reports and studies, only one ofwhich was the kind that Kruger had been looking for.It is hard to test Savory’s methods using conventional scientific studies, which in thiskind of situation might compare two identical plots of land with one changed variable—say, the amount of water or the number of animals on the land—and see how the plotsdiverged on a list of criteria a few years later. But if you isolate one variable, then you’retreating the environment as a machine rather than a complex system—and once you dothat, you’re no longer talking about holistic management. Even Keith Weber, the author ofthe NASA–funded study that Kruger liked, says that the holistic management system thathe and his colleague tested against two other approaches—total rest and a rigidrest/grazing system—wasn’t really true to Savory’s approach.“Truly, if we were doing holistic planned grazing we would have to monitor andchange as we go along,” Weber told me. “With Savory’s approach, you have to monitorhow the landscape is reacting to your management and decide on an annual basis howyou’re going to fix any problems you accidently created. But when you do a scientificexperiment, you can’t change what you’re doing one year into the experiment. You have todo the same thing every year so that you can compare practices. If you make a change,your scientific analysis is thrown out the window.”Weber says that another problem with testing Savory’s approach is that healing theland with cattle takes 5 years or longer, but most scientific experiments are funded foronly 3 years. Sometimes scientists can get funding for another 3-year study to piggyback46on top of the first one, but that’s hard to do.But even though the Savory approach hasn’t been proved to a skeptical scientificmainstream, many ranchers have been impressed enough by Savory’s ideas to attend histraining sessions and turn their own lands over to holistic management. Even without theblessing of mainstream science, the number of these practitioners keeps growing. Savoryand Butterfield know of 10,000 ranchers doing holistic management, although there maycertainly be more.The whole point of the Zimbabwe center, as well as two learning sites in the UnitedStates and a growing number of sites around the world, is to show the method at work.Savory bought the center’s land 40 years ago from a farmer who ran 100 cattle over his6,500 acres (now expanded to 8,650 acres plus an additional 2,500 that the centermanages but does not own), just 25 miles from his original home, which is now a nationalpark. When Savory decided to turn this property into a learning site in 2002, he beganincreasing the number of cattle. When I visited, the center had 500 cows, including theirown along with cows that belong to its herders and to nearby villages. Savory planned todouble that number in 2014 in an attempt to replicate the large herds that used to keep therangeland healthy. “We don’t have enough,” he told me as he frowned at an area withshoulder-high yellow grass. “I want this trampled to the ground.”Savory had taken me and two goat ranchers from Australia on a tour of the property,along dirt roads so rutted I was afraid I’d break a tooth as we rattled into the bush.Occasionally, he stopped the SUV and we’d get out to observe the land. We stopped onceto look at bare ground with such a hard crust on the top that it made a ringing sound whenhit with a stick. Savory told us that 50 percent of the land on this property used to be likethat. He stopped to show us areas that he’d carefully photographed before they weretreated—he calls planned grazing a “treatment”—and invited us to compare thephotographs with what lay before us. Using fixed points like forked or fallen trees, wesaw that the same patch was now denser with yellowed grass. “It used to be so bare herethat you could shoot a guinea fowl at 100 yards,” Savory said. “There was nowhere forthem to hide. Now they can hide at about five yards.”I asked if he could feel the difference in the soil itself with his bare feet. He nodded.“When the land is bare, it gets awfully hot,” he said. “That’s not good for plant life, butpeople with shoes aren’t aware of how damned hot the soil gets.”We drove through miles of yellow grass and black trees, stark yellow hills wrinklingup around us. We passed gray patches of ash that his staff throws out so the birds can dustthe lice off their feathers. We passed Meg’s Spot, the place where back in the 1970s heleft his 6-year old daughter with a rifle to guard some tourists while he trudged off to findsomeone to repair his broken-down vehicle. We passed a tumbled-down rock shack nearthe Dimbangombe River where he had left some visitors to watch the elephants bathingand a group of lions climbed on the roof to share the spectacle. We visited the kraal, a47large circular enclosure made of white plastic where the livestock spend the night, movedweekly for concentrated doses of animal impact across the land. It was empty when wereached it, a bit odd and Christo-like out there in the wilderness. One of the herders cameout from his nearby tent with a few of the Jack Russells that yap a warning at night whenlions, elephants, and hyenas approach. They don’t accompany the herd anymore, as one oftheir numbers was eaten and another bitten by a puff adder. After some driving off-road,we finally came upon the herd itself, which is taken from the kraal each morning to grazea certain part of the range for about 3 days—the whole range is mapped out and dividedaccording to the annual grazing plan.I had to keep pinching myself and saying, “Africa!” even though the yellow landreminded me of the dry winter landscape around my childhood home in northernCalifornia. There were so many reasons to be thrilled about being there. I rode the babyelephant, Dojiwe. I visited Victoria Falls. I woke up one night to the sounds of hyenashowling outside.But the most thrilling moment was when Savory took us to the river that had been drywhen he first bought the property. It had been dry for as long as anyone in the nearbyvillages could remember. It was dry in satellite images from years back. There, springstrickled from the dry winter landscape into the river, now muddied with an abundance ofelephant tracks. The thick grass we saw aboveground was a symptom of the deep healinggoing on in the soil, where microorganisms were building aggregates that both receivedand held on to water. The land was now a mighty reservoir, and I thought it would notreturn to desert anytime soon.# Chapter 4: Letting Nature Do Its Job
A fleet of dusty pickups and SUVs bumped across the North Dakota prairie, thesummer grasses and wildflowers and wiry forbs susurrant against their undersides.From my seat in Jay Fuhrer’s SUV, it sounded as if we were in a boat cresting a river ofchop. We finally pulled up next to one of Mike and Becky Small’s cornfields, jumped outinto the lemony air—the vehicles had crushed a lot of wildflowers called lemon scurfpea—and formed a ragged circle of plaid shirts. At the center stood Fuhrer, the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service conservationist for Burleigh County, the countyseat of which is Bismarck. The sun was blinding, and I was the only foolishly hatlessperson in the group. I hunkered in a tall guy’s shadow, mindful of the tobacco juice hekept spitting to the side.Fuhrer is a compact man with some silver in his hair and a wryly self-deprecatinghabit of referring to himself as “the old German.” On that July morning, he could havedoubled as the genial host of a cooking show. He bent down and carved up a browniesizechunk of soil from the Smalls’s cornfield, broke it apart and waved it in front of hisnose as if savoring the complexity of its ingredients. He passed dark chunks around foreveryone else to sniff and appreciate. Then he wrenched up a cornstalk and shook it untilmost of the soil fell away from its roots. Even with all his shaking, the tangled strandswere still coated in a thick, dark layer of sticky soil. They looked like dreadlocks.“Why doesn’t the soil fall all the way off?” Fuhrer asked the crowd, touching theroots. “The glues in the soil hold it there. There are aggregates being formed right now.”He broke off one of the larger roots and asked someone to pour their bottled waterover it. When it finally washed clean, he sliced it into pieces and passed them around thecrowd, like hors d’oeuvres. I popped a piece in my mouth, and it was—perhapsunsurprisingly—cornlike, sweet and crisp and cool. “Can you taste those sugars?” Fuhrerasked. “Those are the soil exudates! That’s what the plants use to attract the biology.”Just as people from all over the world visit Allan Savory’s holistic grazing model onthe grasslands of Zimbabwe, people from around the United States and beyond visitBurleigh County to see how soil health can be built in land that is actively cropped. Arenegade band of 40 farmers and ranchers there—I’m not sure what they should be called,as most of them both plant crops and raise meat animals—with enthusiastic backup fromFuhrer and USDA scientist Kristine Nichols have done what nearly everyone believes isimpossible: They are building healthy, carbon-rich soil and healing their landscapeswhile increasing yields and making greater profits. And, as Mike Small told me and the49crowd of farmers and Natural Resources Conservation Service employees from Missouriwho toured that week, they also enjoy more time with their families.By its very nature, conventional cropping is a far greater assault on the environmentthan herding animals. Plowing rips apart the crucial underground networks of mycorrhizalfungi and shatters the soil aggregates that hold water and gases in the soil. After theseaggregates break down, the soil particles pack tightly against one another—this is calledsoil compaction—and the land can’t capture and hold the water from either irrigation orrain. In fact, a recent study showed that nearly half of the rise in sea level comes fromwater that runs off agricultural lands. Want to know where the quickly draining OgallalaAquifer is going? Lots of it winds up in the ocean. About 70 percent of America’sfreshwater usage goes to agriculture, but compacted soil means that much of it can’tpenetrate. Tillage equipment is redesigned periodically to strike deeper and deeper tobreak up this compacted soil, but this only creates a new and still deeper layer ofcompaction.In the process of preparing a field for sowing, conventional farmers also remove allthe vegetation so that they can offer a blank slate to the one crop they want to grow andsell, whether it be corn (planted on 24 percent of America’s 406 million acres ofcropland) or wheat (14 percent) or soybeans (19 percent). Weeds, other plants, and evenresidue from a previous year’s crop are removed, often in the fall so that the farmer canplant more quickly the following spring. This leaves the soil bare and exposed for up to 7months. The process wasn’t designed to starve the soil microorganisms, of course, butthat’s what it does, since there are no live roots in the soil to feed them exudates and nodead plant materials lying around for them to gnaw on. When I drove from Cleveland toPortland in the fall of 2012, I sped past what seemed like thousands of these naked brownacres. Sometimes I passed the culprit: a tractor pulling a huge disc, pluming off so muchdust that it was hard to see the highway. It was almost as if I was downwind from a fire.Even most organic farmers conduct this annual ruination of the soil, especially thehuge industrial concerns that produce most of the organic products in our grocery stores.They can’t call themselves organic if they use chemical herbicides to get rid of weeds, sothey till them away.Clearing and tilling farmland has been going on for millennia—some of the world’spoorest soils and communities of people have been created this way—but today’smachinery allows it to happen at a far more massive and accelerated scale. Farmers dropseeds into this degraded soil come spring, but have little hope of growing a crop inground where all the natural processes have been devastated. And not just by tilling andclearing. Without a healthy community of soil microorganisms to provide nutrients,something has to be added. Organic farmers rely on manure, compost, or naturalfertilizers to restore some of the lost nutrients, but most conventional farmers—and about99 percent of our food comes from them—have been subjecting the land to a harsh50chemical bath for years. That’s what nearly every expert they’ve ever encountered hastold them they must do to survive.As entrenched as chemical farming seems, it’s only been around for about 50 years.As with so many innovations, the “process of taking atoms from the atmosphere andcombining them into molecules useful to living beings,” as Michael Pollan writes in TheOmnivore’s Dilemma, is connected with the exigencies of war. Nitrates are needed tomake bombs, and a German-Jewish scientist named Fritz Haber figured out how to makesynthetic nitrates for the bombs and poison gases that were used during World War I. (Healso developed the poison gases later used in concentration camps during World War II,although the Nazis had forced him to leave the country by then.) Weirdly, Haber’s work topull nitrogen from the air was originally undertaken to create chemical fertilizers andboost agricultural productivity. His invention “liberated” agriculture from biologicalprocesses and allowing farmers to raise crops without needing much knowledge ofnatural systems. “Once chemical agriculture came along, you didn’t need any skill, youdidn’t even have to know how to be a farmer,” says Abe Collins, a farmer and soilvisionary from Vermont. “You could just throw that stuff out there, even on reallydegraded land, and get a crop.”Picky consumers like me look for the organic label in a grocery store or, better yet, afarmers’ market, because we have an intuitive feeling that foul-smelling chemicalfertilizers couldn’t possibly make healthy food—we feel that nature’s way has to bebetter, although we don’t really know why. But the new scientific understanding of what’shappening in the soil validates this intuition. Most chemical fertilizers are a mixture of thethree minerals that agricultural scientists long ago determined are essential for plantgrowth: nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. But as microbiologist Elaine Ingham pointsout, as the tools of science get better, scientists pinpoint more and more nutrients in foodsthat are important for our health. Those nutrients aren’t going to reach the plants throughthe application of these chemical fertilizers, because they’re not in the mix. In fact, the fullpanoply of necessary nutrients might never be in the mix, because the interactionsbetween the plants and the soil microorganisms—nature’s way of providing plants withthe minerals they need—are so very complicated and hard to replicate.Even after tilling, soil microorganisms will still be in the soil, but they aren’t likelyto provide these varied nutrients to the plants once the chemical fertilizers are applied.Simply put, these applications interfere with one of nature’s great partnerships. By theterms of this partnership, plants are supposed to distribute carbon sugars through theirroots to the microorganisms in exchange for nutrients. Fertilizer disrupts this pay-as-yougo system. Plants get lazy.“When we add fertilizer, we’re putting nutrients right next to the plant roots and theplant doesn’t have to give up any carbon to get them,” says USDA microbiologist KristineNichols. “Therefore, the soil organisms can’t get enough food.”51Without their carbon meal, the mycorrhizal fungi can’t grow and stretch their strandsof carbon through the soil. They and the other soil microorganisms can’t produce the gluesthat fix carbon in the soil and build the aggregates that hold water. They go dormant and,given enough stress, can die. At that point, the soil is so depleted of life and structure thata farmer can’t get a decent crop without chemical fertilizers, at least not for a couple ofyears. “Then we get into a system where we’re adding more and more fertilizer to try tomaintain or increase our yields,” Nichols says. “We’ll see symptoms that look likefertilizer deficiency when we don’t add enough, because there isn’t that beneficialactivity with the organisms.”Conventional agriculture uses about 32 billion pounds of chemical fertilizers everyyear, but the fertilizers are remarkably inefficient. Much of the phosphorus in chemicalfertilizers quickly binds to minerals in the soil and becomes unavailable to the plants.Soil microorganisms have enzymes to make the phosphorus available, but they’re oftendormant or dead under a chemical regimen. The problems associated with nitrogen uptakeare even worse. Without healthy soil biology to convert the nitrogen into a plant-palatableform, up to 50 percent of the nitrogen is lost, washed away with the rain or irrigationwater into the groundwater or streams. There, it enriches the waters and causes algalgrowth, which sucks oxygen out of the water and creates dead zones. The Gulf of Mexicohas one of the largest dead zones in the world—about 6,000 square miles near the mouthof the Mississippi—caused by fertilizer run-off. The one benefit of the drought of 2012was that the Gulf dead zone shrank because not as much nitrogen-enriched water rolleddown the river.Typically, conventional farmers react to the poor absorption of their chemicals byadding more. They’ll add 100 pounds of nitrogen just to get 50 in the soil.Most farmers are discomfited by the downstream effects of tillage and fertilizer use,but everyone—from their agriculture school professors to their county extension agent—has been telling them for years that this is the way to build a successful business. Now therising price of chemical fertilizers, which are fuel intensive to make and apply, has manyfarmers and the people who work with them looking for a better way. Thus the allure ofBurleigh County: These farmers have gone back to working more closely with naturebecause their crops are as good as or better than—usually better than—when they wentthe chemical route, and they save thousands of dollars not applying chemicals.Our final stop on Mike and Becky Small’s farm was at a field so densely planted thatit wasn’t possible to even see the soil. Just before we climbed back into our vehicles tohead for the next farm on the tour, a young man in a blue plaid shirt and camo cap raisedhis hand. “What are your inputs here?” he asked Small, who just grinned.“Inputs?” Fuhrer frowned as if he didn’t understand.The young guy fell into the trap. “Yeah, inputs. Your fertilizer.”52“None,” Small tells him.“None at all?”“That’s right.”The young man took this in, then sighed. “Will you come down to Missouri and talk tomy dad?”How did the Smalls manage to raise up this jungle of biomass without fertilizer or,for that matter, irrigation, in a part of the country that averages 15 inches of precipitationper year? The answer began to form nearly 15 years earlier, on Gabe Brown’s farmoutside Bismarck, long before the Smalls thought it was possible to depart fromconventional farming. There, nature had a showdown with Gabe Brown on the 5,400-acreproperty he farms with his wife, Shelly, and son, Paul. The Browns completely changedthe way they farm, and their discoveries are rippling through the county and beyond.I had actually planned to visit Gabe Brown even before I found out about Fuhrer’ssoil tour. Two years earlier, I attended a conference in New Mexico hosted by the QuiviraCoalition, a group that convenes progressive ranchers and environmentalists to talk abouthow good agriculture can solve many of the environmental problems both worry about.The theme of the conference was “The Carbon Ranch: Using Food and Stewardship toBuild Soil and Fight Climate Change”—totally in line with my interests. Still, I waited tosign up until the last minute, so I didn’t get a room at the hotel where the conference washeld. This may be why I’ll never give up procrastination. I had to stay in an off-site moteland catch a shuttle every morning to the conference, and, because of that, wound up sittingnext to Eliav Bitan several mornings in a row. At that time, he was the agriculture advisorto the National Wildlife Federation’s Climate and Energy Program. The NWF haddeclared that the greatest threat to wildlife was global climate change, and Bitan had theenviable task of going around the country to study the work of progressive farmers andcull “future-friendly” farming practices for a report. We stayed in touch and finally metagain in North Dakota so he could introduce me to Gabe Brown.I flew out in July of 2012, at the height of the droughtiest summer in 50 years,wondering as my plane circled the Bismarck airport about the rigid sentinels of treesmarking up the countryside. From the air, it looked as if someone had thrown down ahandful of pick-up sticks. When Bitan and I arrived at Brown’s farm, I found out that thesewere massive tree breaks, one of the conservation practices instituted in the wake of theDust Bowl years of the Great Depression. In the years leading up to the Dust Bowl,farmers had become reckless “sodbusters,” using the biggest machines they could find totear up the native prairie and make their fortunes planting wheat. They did nothing to carefor the soil; instead, they kept raking it open for more and more crops. These bad farmingpractices ultimately collided with drought. Instead of rain, they got powerful winds thatwhipped the bare soil into enormous dust storms that blocked out the sun for days and53sickened people and animals. North Dakota had been hit hard by this man-made “natural”disaster. On Jay Fuhrer’s soil tour, a visiting scientist from Missouri speculated that DustBowl winds had resurrected boulders that were now lying around in the fields from deepunder the soil, where glaciers had deposited them millions of years before.But everything was green at the Brown farm, even with only 8 inches of rain since thebeginning of the year; crazy green, green in a kind of horticultural chaos that didn’t evenslightly suggest the neat geometry we associate with farming. I think I had an initialdismayed moment that it wasn’t pretty. Where were the tidy rows of crops? Where werethe smooth green fields decoratively dotted with black-and-white cows? Instead, therewere uncropped fields that were thick with vegetation, an Eraserhead profusion of plantsjammed together and—except for the occasional sunflower nodding its bright face overthe fray—unidentifiable from a distance. Even the cornfield was messy, with both livingand dead plants crowded between the rows of corn. And the livestock? They were amulticolored gang of cows and calves bunched together on a small piece of Gabe’s 5,400acres, cordoned off with mobile electric fencing into an inelegant configuration. The onlytidy spot was the yard around the Brown’s house, which Gabe’s wife, Shelly, wascircling on a riding mower.This was one of those moments when I realized I had to retrain my sense of beautywhen it came to farming. As Marlyn Richter, one of the other farmers we visited on thesoil tour said, “Our dad thought we were nuts when we started doing this. He wanted theplace to be pretty, with neat brown rows. But now, the uglier it looks, the better we feelabout it.”Gabe Brown is a broad-shouldered, sturdy man with a Northern Plains drawl and aquick laugh, who always looks as if he’s peering into the distance, figuring out his nextexperiment. He wasn’t born to the art and science of farming—he grew up a Bismarckcity boy—but loved the outdoors and took a vocational agriculture class in ninth grade.He became hooked on farming and spent his summers working at a dairy farm 50 milesaway.Shelly’s father was a farmer, and he sometimes hired Brown to clear his fields ofrocks. Gabe and Shelly didn’t date in high school; she knew she didn’t want to marry afarmer and only wanted friendship with Future Farmers of America types like Gabe. Butby the time they finished 2 years at Bismarck State College, they were wed. Gabe went onto get a 4-year degree from North Dakota State in Fargo, where he majored in animalscience and agricultural economics. Even though he was passionate about these subjects,he winced at the way they were taught. “It didn’t seem like the puzzle was fittingtogether,” he told me, easing back in his camo-covered lounger during a long interview inhis basement. “Each enterprise on the farm was separate and we weren’t looking at thebigger picture. I was frustrated with that, but at the time I didn’t know why.”Gabe and Shelly moved to her parents’ farm to help them manage it, and they54purchased a part of the farm in 1991. At that point, Brown was a conventional farmer, nota revolutionary one. He tilled, he applied fertilizer, he sprayed pesticides, herbicides,and fungicides, and he hung fly-killing ear tags on his cows.By 1993, though, tilling seemed wrongheaded to him. “It didn’t make any sense thatwe dug up the soil and then complained later that it was too dry,” he explained. “Andsince I didn’t grow up on a farm, it wasn’t ingrained in me to do exactly what Dad andGrandpa did.” He talked to a no-till-farming friend—there weren’t many in the countyback then—and the friend advised him that if he was thinking of going no-till, he had tosell his plows. Otherwise, he’d always be tempted to go back to tilling.So Brown sold his tilling equipment. He bought a shiny yellow-and-green John Deere750 no-till drill that makes a tiny slit in the soil, drops a seed inside, then quickly sealsthe gap. He started to depart from the ag school regimen in other ways that made sense tohim, too, such as sowing legumes in his pastures to fix nitrogen in the soil. He wasdisappointed with the amount of forage growing in 200 acres of “tame” grass—pastureseeded with store-bought grass as opposed to native prairie grasses—and sought advicefor bumping up production. The standard advice from agricultural extension educatorswas to add fertilizer, but he couldn’t afford more fertilizer. He consulted with Jay Fuhrerand they decided to seed 12 pastures with different legumes—alfalfa, cicer milkvetch,bird’s-foot trefoil, and clover, as well as eight others—to see which improved productionthe most. “We got tremendous production,” he said. “That showed me the synergybetween grasses and legumes both in cropland and pasture. We had a lot of peoplecoming to visit these pastures because they were way more productive than monoculturetame-grass pastures.”And then he had his epic, crushing, biblical-level bout with nature. For 4 years in arow, weather anomalies—either hail or late frost or extreme drought—wiped out most ofhis crops. For 4 years, he couldn’t take much of anything to market. To make do, he sowedhis ruined fields with summer crops just to have some feed for his cattle. He tried sowingcorn in 1997, but the plants withered in a drought. Instead of clearing the fieldmechanically with a tractor and disc, he sent in his cows to eat the stalks. He also sowedcover crops in the fall—these are plants grown in the market-crop off-season to protectthe soil from wind and rain erosion—hoping they might improve moisture. He noticed thathis soil health seemed to be improving, but really, survival and hanging on to the farmwere his only concerns.“That fourth year, we lost 80 percent of our crop to hail,” Brown recalled. “It’sawfully tough to make bank payments when you have no income. That was a tough time,but it was the best thing that could have happened because I never would be where I amtoday without those 4 years. We were forced to change.”By this time, Brown couldn’t afford to buy fertilizer—he was broke—but he realizedthat his departures from conventional agricultural practices had been improving his soil55so much that he might not even need it. So he kept looking for other ways to farm andranch successfully without expensive chemicals. In 1998, he took a course in Savory’sholistic management methods. He learned that set stocking or season-long grazing—thoseare terms for what most ranchers do when they turn out their animals to wander one largepasture for the entire year—encourages the cows to eat their preferred grasses past thepoint of recovery and allows weeds to take over. He began the process of turning hispastureland into more than 100 smaller paddocks and rotating his cattle through themevery few days, allowing the grasses plenty of time to regenerate.Right around that time, Brown became a supervisor with the Burleigh County SoilConservation District, and he and Jay Fuhrer became a convention-busting team, eager totest any new ideas that sounded promising. Brown expanded his cover-crop mixes toinclude a few more varieties, and word started to spread about his healthy soil.Then Kristine Nichols, at the time a new soil microbiologist with the USDA’sAgricultural Resource Service in nearby Mandan, came to visit. Impressed by what shesaw going on with Brown’s soil, she urged him to cut back on the amount of chemicalfertilizers he was using (now that his farm was more successful, he’d gone back to usingfertilizer). He recalls her saying, “Gabe, you’ve got to reduce and eventually eliminateyour commercial fertility so your soil biology will function as it should. That’s the onlyway your system can become sustainable.”Brown embarked upon an extended trial to test her suggestion, using fertilizer on halfof each individual field and leaving it off on the other half. After 4 years, the halveswithout fertilizer consistently outperformed the other halves, so it was easy to decide toditch the cost and bother of applying fertilizer. Clearly, all the other steps he’d taken—nottilling, the cover crops, the occasional foray by cows to eat crop residue—had changedthe soil so that his crops didn’t need fertilizer. Soil health became an obsession forBrown at that point, with Fuhrer and Nichols his ever-eager partners.In 2006, Brown and Fuhrer attended a No-Till on the Plains conference in Kansas. ABrazilian crop consultant named Ademir Calegari took the dais to talk about the covercrop“cocktails” farmers were using to build soil health in South America. Cover cropsthemselves have been used by farmers for thousands of years to curb erosion and runoff;the leaves catch raindrops and allow them to drip on the soil slowly, preventing themfrom hammering soil particles apart and giving the water more time to percolate down.Despite these benefits, cover crops are not widely used in the United States. In fact, aNational Wildlife Federation study showed that in 2011, only a maximum of 4.3 millionacres of the Mississippi River Basin’s 277 million acres was planted in cover crops.Gabe Brown had noticed that water runoff from his cropland dropped dramaticallyafter he started using his simple two- and three-species cover-crop mixes, and as helearned more about the science of soil health, he suspected that the cover crops weredoing more than just reducing erosion and runoff. The cover crops ensured that his soil56biology was being fed throughout the year, not just while he was growing his commoditycrops of wheat and corn. With these underground engineers building soil aggregates andorganic matter year-round, his land had become spongelike, soaking in and holding waterso that his crops thrived even during dry weather.The cocktails that Ademir Calegari suggested bumped the cover-crop concept to anew level. One of the most unnatural practices of conventional farming is its creation ofvast landscapes in which only one plant is grown, usually corn or wheat or soybeans. Butsuch “monocultures” never occur in nature. A square foot of the native prairie near GabeBrown’s farm has up to 140 plant species. An acre of land alongside any Americanhighway probably has more plant species than all of Iowa’s cropped lands put together. Alush mixture of plants aboveground means that there is a correspondingly lush communityof microorganisms underground, as the different plants offer different root exudates andattract an array of different microorganisms, making the soil overall more resilient.Nature is always trying to restore balance to landscapes that humans degrade. When wecreate bare land, nature sends a battalion of weeds to colonize and cover the soil. Whenwe establish a monoculture, nature sends in pathogens to weaken and even kill that crop,allowing other species to fill the void.“If you grow a monocrop for an extended period of time, you’re promoting pathogensthat are specific to that crop,” says John Klironomos, a biologist at the University ofBritish Columbia. “This stimulates diversity. Nature won’t let any one species dominate aparticular area, but pathogens won’t find a host in a very diverse agricultural system.”Ironic that we immediately think that crops are sick when they’re afflicted with apathogen, when this is nature’s way of making the landscape healthy again.Gabe and Jay left the No-Till on the Plains conference eager to put Calegari’sconcept into trials. They went to the grain elevator, which not only receives and pays forcommodity crops but also sells seed. They flummoxed the folks there by requesting 1,000pounds of turnip seed. “How many seed packets do you want?” was the astonished reply.But finally, Brown and Fuhrer gathered up enough bulk seed to plant test fields onconservation district land, some as monocultures and some as cocktails. Soil healthseemed to improve with the cocktails. The drama came during the dry summer of 2006,when the county got only an inch of rain between the time that they sowed the trial fieldsin May and clipped and weighed the growth in late July, some 70 days later. Most of themonoculture crops died, but the cover-crop cocktail fields had grown like mad. “Thatshowed us that there was a tremendous beneficial influence from growing these cropstogether,” Gabe said. He began planting cover-crop cocktails himself.The next arc of his learning curve came in 2008, when he spoke at a grazingconference in Manitoba. A rancher named Neil Dennis from Saskatchewan approachedhim after his talk and told him about his experiment with another innovative practicecalled mob grazing. Brown typically ran 50,000 pounds of cattle on an acre—about 4057cows—but Dennis was running an astounding million pounds of cattle per acre. Brownsat up until 3:00 in the morning looking at photos on Dennis’s computer. The followingJune, he visited Dennis’s operation and was stunned by the health of his soil.The mob grazing concept builds upon the insights of André Voisin and Allan Savory,namely that even very large numbers of animals are good for the land if one controls theamount of time they spend there. With carefully monitored grazing times that gave theplants time to recover, Dennis found that the beneficial impacts of herbivores on the landwere multiplied by having lots of them there: lots of hooves breaking up the hard surfaceof the soil, lots of grasses trampled into the ground, lots of grasses being tugged and bittenand causing the plants to pulse carbon sugars into the soil, and lots of nutritious dung,urine, and hair spread around for the insects and microorganisms to break down.Now, the Browns have a winning trifecta of soil-health practices: no-till plantingcombined with cover-crop cocktails, followed by mob grazing. They currently turn nearlythree-quarters of a million pounds of cattle onto their pastures and also let them storm thecover-crop-cocktail fields. Not that there haven’t been other innovations, as well—Brown says he wants to make sure he and Paul fail at one new thing every year, maybemore, just to make sure they’re stretching. For instance, most ranchers arrange their cows’breeding cycle so that they give birth in late winter, inside corrals. The Browns decidedthey wanted their cows to give birth in May, out on the fresh grass and in the sunshine.“Out there, the cow is consuming a healthy fresh diet instead of hay or something that tookfossil fuels to get in front of her,” Brown said. “And it’s a clean environment for thenewborn, no different from that of the bison or antelope or deer.” This innovation wasn’ta failure!There are now chickens on the farm as well as sheep, adding to the diversity ofimpact on and inputs into the land. Basically, that’s what the Browns are always lookingfor: ways to stack enterprises on the farm so that they make more money on the sameacreage and keep building soil health. When Gabe Brown first met Kris Nichols, she toldhim that the herd under the soil was just as large as the herd on top of the soil, but farmore important for the long-term success of his operation. “You have to think aboutmanaging the organisms in the soil the way you think about managing for any healthyherd,” she told me when I visited her at the Mandan research center. “They need constantand high-nutritive-value food sources. They need a good habitat. They need protectionfrom diseases and predators. When Gabe manages his cattle, he’s utilizing them as a toolto manage the soil for that other herd.”When Gabe Brown takes visitors around, they admire the cows munching amiably onacres of green. But he’s thinking about that much larger herd down in the soil, steadilylapping up the carbon sugars and turning them into black gold.By the time I visited him in the summer of 2012, Brown was famous—between hisspeaking gigs and visits from scientists and farming consultants, it was like trying to get58on a rock star’s schedule. His son, Paul, had made T-shirts to mark this transformation,navy blues with Brown’s face and GABE MANIA! on the front in white and WORLDTOUR 2012 on the back, along with a list of all the places where he had spoken. Gabemodestly declined to show me one. He was producing 127 bushels of corn per acre, 27more bushels than the county average, without fertilizer, pesticides, or fungicides, andwith just a small amount of herbicide. He was spending between $1.00 to $1.25 toproduce that bushel, whereas the county’s average cost per bushel was between $3.00 to$3.50. The corn and wheat were sold to standard commodity markets, and the cattle tospecialty buyers of grass-fed beef. The soil organic matter in his cropped lands has gonefrom 1.7 to 5.3 percent, which he thinks is not nearly high enough—he’d like to get thecroplands as high as his pastures, which are at 7.3 percent. His son, Paul, is determinedto get both up to 12 percent. While other farmers continued to think that they needed tobuy more land and become larger to be successful—that’s been the assumption for years—Gabe Brown decided to become smaller. He was making enough money that he couldsacrifice acreage—he discontinued leases on 640 extra acres—allowing him to spendmore effort fine-tuning his management.Gabe Brown was scowling at the sky when Eliav Bitan and I arrived. A silvery cropdustingplane streamed a contrail of pesticide over a distant field of sunflowers. Brownwas as dismayed as if it were the Wicked Witch of the West from the Oz fantasy spelling,“Surrender Dorothy” in the sky. “That just makes me sick,” he said. “I don’t want thatstuff drifting over on my crops.”Then we climbed into his black four-door truck, his border collie Pistol leaping intothe back just as we pulled away from the house, and raised our own contrail of dust. Weheaded off to see a 60-acre field that Paul had sowed with cover-crop cocktails, half with19 species and half with 26—another trial to educate themselves about soil health. Wedrove past the odd nomenclature of North Dakota country roads—they had names likeFirst Avenue South and 102 Avenue Southeast to help firemen and police map their way tofar-flung homes, but the names looked odd on intersections with no buildings in sight. Wedrove past fields that were green and fields that had already had their hay harvested andspun into big golden cylinders.Paul’s field was one of the green ones. Sunflowers raised their fist-size buds high. Somany shorter plants of varying heights crowded around them that it looked as if thesunflowers could have stood upright, even without roots. When I bent in to look closer, Isaw tiny flowers—white and yellow and blue—dangling in the green. I spied pinkishdisks of turnip and radish in the soil below. “We’re going for a forest canopy structurehere,” Brown said, more for my benefit than Bitan’s—he’d heard all this before. “Like arainforest, with high, medium, and low layers to the canopy. And we want different leaftypes, too, different shapes. They’re my solar collectors. No matter what angle thesunlight is, we’re collecting the maximum amount of energy.”59He reached out to touch a dainty blue flower. It was flax, which they plant becausethe cattle don’t like to eat it. In fact, they only leave the cows in the field long enough toeat 25 percent of the plant material (and yes, they eat the turnips but just nibble at theradishes). The rest is stomped to the ground for the other herd. Brown reached for a sprigof buckwheat, which he and Paul plant because it scavenges phosphorous from the soiland makes it available to other plants. He pointed out the plants that had 8-foot roots andthose with shallow ones. Just as they want the plants to fill up the space above the soil,they want the roots to occupy all areas of the soil profile below. “That’s biologicaltillage,” Brown said. “That’s nature’s way of getting rid of soil compaction.”Fine-limbed gray spiders climbed up his arms as he spoke. Behind him, a scrim ofwhite butterflies drifted through the field. When I remarked upon the abundance of insects,he nodded. “We had an entomologist out here the other day, and he was just amazed. Hewas like a kid in a candy store.”Brown’s farm is like a candy store to scientists who are interested in studying naturalsystems in agriculture (or who aren’t chemical-spray-loving “nozzle-heads,” as somepeople call the researchers in conventional agriculture). The visiting entomologist wasJonathan Lundgren from the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service in Brookings, SouthDakota, and he was dazzled by the impact Brown’s cover crops were having on his insectcommunity.“Most farmers think that if they see an insect, they have to kill it,” Lundgren told meon the phone. “But there are only 3,000 insect pests in the world that eat our crops andhurt our livestock. For each one of those pests, there are around 3,000 beneficial insects.We don’t even have names for most of them yet. Spraying wipes out that whole insectcommunity, including the enemies of those pests. I’d like to see us manage our fields sothat we keep those beneficial insects around.”And that’s what he’s finding in Brown’s fields. Brown doesn’t know exactly whichplants are attracting the predators of the agricultural pests; he just tries to make sure thathis cover-crop mixes attract pollinators and that they provide a good habitat for spiders.He assumes that if he maintains plant diversity on the ground, insect diversity will follow.And even though studies haven’t shown why this approach is working—Lundgren plans tohelp with that—Brown knows his approach is working. He hasn’t used pesticides in 12years and hasn’t needed to.For instance, Brown doesn’t have trouble with the corn rootworm, a beetle larva thateats corn roots, which Lundgren says is the number one agricultural pest in America.Billions of pesticide dollars are spent every year to combat this pest, but they also harmthe rest of the insect community—and they wind up creating super pests when the badinsects develop resistance to the poison. Lundgren has been investigating the stomachs ofother insects for evidence of corn rootworm DNA and has identified dozens of predators.“The predator community will be there if we provide the right environment for them,” he60explained. Gabe Brown’s fields are attracting the predators, and Lundgren suspects thatsomething else is going on, too. He believes that the cover-crop cocktails are changing theroot structure of the corn plants and inducing the corn rootworm to venture away from theprotection of the roots where they are nailed by predators. When I spoke to him in 2013,he had submitted a grant proposal to the USDA to research how, exactly, the diverse plantand insect varieties in Brown’s fields are working together to defeat the corn rootworm.Brown’s lively insect population may also be the cause of his dwindling need forherbicides. Insects don’t eat just plants and other insects; they’re also granivores that eatseeds. Most of the crops that farmers sow have been bred to bear large seeds, whicharen’t appealing to these small granivores. But weeds have tiny seeds and a vigorouspropagation mechanism that shoots out thousands of the seeds—millions in many species—over the course of a growing season. These tiny seeds are a tasty meal to the rightinsect. Unwittingly, farmers who kill off their insect populations to get rid of one pest maybe making it easier for their weeds to dominate.Gabe Brown doesn’t always know exactly why these diverse plant and insectpopulations have such a positive impact on his business; he just has all the anecdotalevidence he needs to convince himself and many others that they do. But Lundgren enjoysfiguring out the science behind the success, especially since no one else has even thoughtof researching these complex relationships. It’s a great partnership. “I’ve really learnedfrom Gabe,” he says. “He’s as much driving my research program as I’m helping him, ifnot more. The stuff he and some of these other progressive farmers are doing is the futureof farming.”In fact, one of the things that distinguishes these progressive farmers and ranchers istheir eagerness to work with progressive scientists—meaning those whose work is nothog-tied by the vast research budgets of the corporations that make money on fertilizersand other products that work against nature, or by the academic agriculture departmentsthat survive on those budgets. Brown also has a great partnership with Rick Haney, a soilscientist with the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service in Temple, Texas.Haney came from a farming family and always wanted to be a farmer himself, but hecouldn’t afford to buy land when he left college in the 1980s. So he went into soil scienceand has farmed his research station’s 200-acre test plot for the last 12 years. Unlike thecity-raised Brown, he had been schooled by his family to adhere to the rules ofconventional farming. “I’d been tilling forever,” he told me. “It wasn’t until just a coupleof years ago that it hit me that I was destroying nature’s brilliantly designed undergroundsystem to move minerals and nutrients and water.”Haney’s real education about the soil came from studying Gabe Brown and otherfarmers. He soon realized that the way his profession analyzed soil was completelyinadequate and outdated. Most of the soil tests that are currently in use were designedbetween 40 and 60 years ago, and they reflect the mind-set of an earlier age, which61viewed soil as a mixture of chemicals rather than a complex, living system. He decided tocreate a soil test that reflected this natural complexity. “I’m a big fan of nature,” he says.“Nature has about 3 billion years of research and development. I try to mimic in the labwhat nature does outside.”Soil samples are routinely dried in a kiln so that they all have the same moisturecontent and are therefore comparable. One of Haney’s innovations is that he rewets thatdried sample, then measures the amount of carbon dioxide gassed off over 24 hours.When the sample is dry, the microorganisms become dormant. When it’s wetted again,they wake up, get back to work, and begin to breathe. That pulse of carbon dioxidereveals the vitality of the microorganism community and the soil’s overall fertility. WhenHaney first tried to publish a paper about this drying and rewetting method, a reviewer atone journal commented, “You can’t do that. It’s too simple.”Haney also devised a method to get a better bead on soil nutrients. Conventional soiltesting uses harsh chemicals to extract minerals from a sample, but Haney felt that thesechemicals caused an incorrect measurement because they pull things from the soil thataren’t actually available to the plants. So he came up with his own water-based extractantbased on the chemistry of the root exudates. His test also looks for all the different formsof various nutrients. For instance, conventional soil tests typically only look for inorganicnitrogen, but Haney had observed that plants were thriving in soils that had only half asmuch inorganic nitrogen as the experts deemed adequate. Using scientific techniquesperfected only in the last decade, Haney’s test also measures the organic nitrogen in thesoil that the other tests miss.Haney offers farmers this more accurate depiction of what’s actually going on in theirsoils, coupled with advice about cover-crop cocktails that include combinations ofgrasses and legumes to get the maximum benefit from the huge pool of nitrogen already inmost soils. This allows farmers to cut back on their nitrogen fertilizer—anenvironmentally sound move and a huge cost cutter for the farmers. “These fertilizershave been used for 50 years as an insurance policy because they were fairly cheap,”Haney says. “That’s not the case today, so there’s a lot more interest in getting by withless.”Plato said that “necessity is the mother of invention” (at least Wikipedia ascribes it toPlato; I was pretty sure it wasn’t Frank Zappa!), and farmers and ranchers are facingsome stark necessities these days. The rising cost of chemical inputs is certainly one ofthem; the other is the unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change. Soilmicrobiologist Kristine Nichols suspects that the agriculturalists in Burleigh County havebeen more inventive and receptive to change because they work in such an unforgivingclimate: They have a short growing season and frequent drought. But as the rest of thenation found out in the drought of 2012, no one can assume there will be an abundance ofrain at the right time. The challenge is to build healthy soils so that every drop of rain62goes to good use.The high point of my visit to Gabe Brown’s farm came after we left Paul’s field andchurned over a gravel road to one of Gabe’s cornfields. He had been carrying around aslim 4-foot metal rod. He told me it was a moisture probe, but he had been using it topoint out the different plants and insects in Paul’s field. Then we walked into thecornfield, which seemed to be at least a foot taller than any of the neighbors’, and henudged it into a bit of bare soil. And then—and then!—he pushed all 4 feet of the rodstraight into the ground, all the way up to his knuckles.“I can’t believe that!” I think I dropped my recorder. “Do it again!”So he walked a few feet away and shoved the rod into the soil again, then pulled itout and held it out to me. “You try it.”My arms aren’t nearly as substantial as Brown’s. Where his arms bulge with muscle,mine jiggle. Without much expectation of success, I took the rod and pushed it into theground. I tried it in several places. And each time, I pushed the rod all the way up to myknuckles. I knew what an amazing thing this was, since I’ve been a backyard gardenerever since I was 25. Even after years of babying my beds with bags of compost, I neverhad soil like that in Gabe Brown’s cornfield. I could hardly stick a fork in my lawn backin Cleveland! But through his management of this harsh landscape, he had created soil thatwas so rich with microbial life that they had built aggregates going down at least 4 feet.Four feet of carbon-rich soil, stacked with billions of tiny cups to hold water.Brown shrugged. “I don’t worry about drought.”We tried the moisture probe in another of Brown’s cornfields as well as in a crazyfield where he has 75 species of flowers and vegetables planted for his family and thelocal food bank—it’s a nutritional jungle where you can’t take a step without crushing abanquet-size portion of vegetables. The only place the moisture probe wouldn’t penetratewas in his neighbor’s field, who is a no-till farmer who hasn’t tried the cover-cropcocktail and some of Brown’s other innovations.What would happen if all agriculture went the way of Gabe Brown’s farm? After wespent the day walking around his fields, we sat in a barn to talk and watch a slide showEliav Bitan had prepared. Bitan had gathered up the meager scientific studies on some ofthese “future-friendly farming” practices. Even a modest two-or-three species cover cropcauses a 90 percent reduction in sediment runoff and a 50 percent reduction in fertilizerrunoff into the watershed, and sequesters a metric ton of carbon dioxide per acre. Bitanadded together the measured impact of simple cover crops and other helpful practices—although none, in these studies, was undertaken to improve soil health—and surmised thatthese practices on US cropland could absorb 5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in theUnited States. But he thinks that estimate falls far short of the real potential.“What if you were actually trying to maximize the soil?” he asked. “Could the soil63absorb a fifth of our greenhouse gas emissions? Some people think we can, but thescience just doesn’t exist yet.”How might healthy soils affect the annual flooding that goes on in North Dakota andother states? Floods cause around $8 billion in damage every year, and states spendbillions to prevent them—North Dakota alone plans to invest nearly $2 billion in a 35-mile flood diversion channel around Fargo. But what if the rain penetrated the land, as itdoes on Gabe Brown’s farm, instead of running off? It took him 15 years to create the kindof healthy soil that can absorb a very heavy rainfall, which is another commonplace ofclimate change. But now he has little fear of flooding. In 1993, an infiltration test of thesoil in one of his fields showed that it could only absorb a half-inch of rain in an hour. A2012 test showed that the same field can now absorb 8 inches in a hour.Many soil scientists are stuck in their labs and research plots, but Kris Nichols’s jobcompels her to spend time with farmers and try to make the science serve their needs.Besides, she’s deeply interested in what’s going on out there. Her father was thecommissioner of agriculture in Minnesota and her family has a long history with thechallenges of farming. “My career was probably supposed to be looking at fungi,” shesaid with a laugh when I visited her in Mandan. “A fungus caused the potato famine inIreland and that brought my family to this country!”Just as she has helped Gabe Brown change, he’s helped her change, too. “Sometimeseducation can be limiting,” she told me. “We think we can go just so far, but what Gabeand Marlyn and the others have shown me is that we can go a lot farther. They’ve shownme something unbelievable.”Nichols stands out among her peers, not all of whom are convinced that enoughcarbon can be captured and stored stably enough in the soil to make an impact on globalwarming. They look at the most intransigent part of soil carbon, called humin—the partthat’s been eaten and processed by microorganisms so many times that it’s nearly inert—and note that it takes hundreds and even thousands of years for that sort of evolution.Some of these other soil scientists aren’t impressed by the many other less-concentratedforms of carbon in the soil, because that carbon could more easily be lost to theatmosphere. But Nichols pointed out that farmers like Gabe Brown are adding vasteramounts of carbon to the soil than any of their agricultural predecessors did. And giventheir dense concentrations of cover crops, much of the carbon they add comes from rootexudates, which become humin more quickly. In short, she said, these other scientistsaren’t familiar with the innovations of the Burleigh County farmers and other agriculturalpioneers around the county.“Some of the things we’re doing with cover crops and livestock are adding so muchmore value than the old conservation methods,” Nichols explained. “Will that restore theprairies’ native carbon content? Personally, I think it’s possible.”64There’s another reason I love the story of the Burleigh County farmers and ranchers.Most people think that good agriculture is a luxury reserved for boutique farmers whowork a day job as computer programmers or whatever. Gabe Brown and his colleagueshave shown that when you understand nature and work with her, farming becomes easierand cheaper, not harder and more costly.“If we get out of the way, nature will do most of the work,” Rick Haney told me. Andthat’s the path of least resistance that Brown follows. He crisscrosses his fields withheavy machinery far less than he used to. He sprays hardly any chemicals. His two herds—cattle and microbes—clear up his fields. And he doesn’t want geneticallymollycoddled cows that don’t know how to be cows. When he turns them out onto snowcoveredfields, he expects them to nuzzle aside the snow and eat the cover crops buriedthere. He expects them to figure out how to meet their moisture needs with snow so hedoesn’t have to drag water out to them. If they don’t, he sells them and invests in sturdierstock.When the soil tour visited Marlyn Richter’s farm, Richter regaled the crowd withstories of his parents’ disapproval when he and his brother wanted to change the routine.He had been equally scornful himself only a few years earlier. The Richter brothers arethird-generation farmers. His grandfather bought the farm during the Dust Bowl years. Hisparents raised 14 children there and still live there themselves.“I used to see Gabe Brown with his soil charts and his talk about water infiltration,and I’d think that it was all BS,” Richter told the group. A big guy, he was wearing a gymT-shirt, and his chest and arms suggested he went often. “I was tilling and I thought, ‘Noway that water’s not going down!’ But I was driven to change by struggling with thesesandy soils.” Then he waved his hand at one of the fields, which used to be so hard that itwas tough to sink a plow into it. Now he’s gone no-till, planted cover crops, and grazeshis just-weaned calves on it. His soil has gone from 0.8 to 2.6 percent organic matter, andhe’s reduced his herbicides and cut his fertilizer use by 15 percent.He and his brother are also working less. They now take Sundays off. That reallyshocks their father, who was so convinced of the need for grueling, grinding, never-endingwork on the farm that he used to tell the boys to hoist an anvil and carry it around if theyseemed to be slacking.I repeated this story to Gabe Brown in his basement and he laughed. “I tease mybuddy Marlyn all the time that he’s not moving fast enough,” he said. “They need to get ridof all the commercial fertility. They need to put those milk cows out to graze. They’redoing things like chopping up feed and bringing it to the cattle. We used to do that yearsago, too, but we want to let nature run its course. Let the cattle do the work.”He settled his cap back on his head. “Marlyn’s got to get lazier.”
# Chapter 5: Cashing In on CarbonI drove the nearly 2 hours from the Perth airport to Bob Wilson’s house with a redribbon tied around the pointer finger of my left hand. I waved it every time I had tomake a turn or face oncoming traffic. “Keep to the left, keep to the left,” I chanted in aneffort to keep myself on the correct side of the road. “Be a leftist!” Honestly, I don’tunderstand why the Australian government even allows Americans to drive there withouttaking a course. I was more frightened exiting the Perth airport parking lot than I’d everbeen during my many weeks in Afghanistan working on a book (Kabul Beauty School),even more rattled than when I’d been driven through a part of the country rumored to beTaliban friendly. I figured my life was much more likely to end on the chrome snout of anoncoming truck in Australia than at the hands of some Talib chumming for small foreignfry. And there was the poor truck driver to worry about.My fear didn’t dissipate when I finally turned down the country road calledMimegarra that would take me to Wilson’s farm. He had appended this note to his emaileddirections just before I left the States: “If a kangaroo runs in front of you, keepgoing straight ahead. Do not attempt to stop or swerve!” I drove down the road so slowlythat butterflies outpaced me, but fortunately, no kangaroos bounded from the bush at thesides of the road to make me test Wilson’s order—given, he said, because I’d likely hitthe kangaroo and flip the car if I tried to stop or swerve. I meandered along, taking sadnote of the humps of fur and blackened hide from the many unfortunate collisions betweenkangaroos and cars. And I couldn’t help noticing the white powder dusting the edges ofthe road, but didn’t stop to find out what it was. Some kind of fertilizer? Ash?I figured out what it was when I arrived at Wilson’s farm and took the wrong road, upa hill lined with dying pine trees and past the driveway to his home. My car sank and mytires struggled, even though I was clearly on a road of sorts. I opened my door and lookeddown to see that the road was just a thin covering of grass and wildflowers over a slopeof fine white sand. A green wig over a white skull.“Yeahhh,” Wilson told me later, after I backed down the hill, parked near his home,and was discovered by his Jack Russell terrier. “We’re basically on top of an immensesand dune here. The ancient waterline was over there, at the Darling Escarpment.” Hepointed across a valley at the long green ridge I’d driven just to the west of on my way upfrom Perth.Wilson and his wife, Anne, had offered to host me on a whirlwind tour of WesternAustralia’s soil health activists. Many of these activists had been influenced by Christine66Jones, a former academic who studied sheep, became interested in the way the quality oftheir wool was affected by what they ate, and then became interested in how the health ofthe soil affected their forage. Back in 1981, when she was a research fellow at thedepartment of agronomy and soil science at the University of New England in New SouthWales, she began speaking to farmers about their soil and convincing many that the key tosuccess laid in their underground trove of carbon. She was very specific about how tobuild that carbon, too, urging them to keep the land covered with growing green plants,which feed exudates to the soil microorganisms—what she calls the “liquid carbonpathway.” After seeing a television program on Jones’s work to rebuild landscape health,an Australian couple brimming with admiration—Allan and Kay Hill—offered her$125,000 to speed her work along. She used the money to set up a series of annualawards for agriculturalists who were doing the best farming for soil health as well askeeping their businesses profitable. Wilson won the first $25,000 A. and K. Hill GreenAgriculture Innovation Award in 2009 and was going to spend the next few days takingme around to visit other outstanding farmers in Western Australia. Then, I would fly to theeast coast of Australia and attend Jones’s fourth award ceremony in Bega, a town in abucolic valley near the sea in New South Wales.Shortly after my arrival, Wilson whisked me outside to see his operation before thesun set. It was hard walking back to the car, as the sand sucked at my shoes where theground was bare, and hard to imagine anyone growing anything on it. He told me that if hewere farming conventionally—in this part of the country, that used to mean plowing andplanting shallow-rooted annual grasses and clovers for the cattle to graze—he wouldhave failed long ago. However, Wilson is an innovative farmer, like Gabe Brown, andbegan testing new ideas years ago. Back in 1985, he started planting a legume shrubcalled tagasaste to feed his cattle during the dry months and to keep the wind fromwhirling away his topsoil, such as it is. He now has about 2,500 acres of pasturecrisscrossed with hedgerows of tagasaste.Then in 2003, he took the far more radical step of planting subtropical perennialgrasses. Also like Gabe Brown, he had a partner in this innovation, an extension officerfrom the commonwealth’s Department of Agriculture and Food named Tim Wiley. It wasan anxiety-producing move, as they didn’t know which perennials would perform well, ifat all, and the seed was expensive. But the new grasses flourished. And because theywere deep-rooted perennials, they could withstand the vagaries of Western Australia’sincreasingly erratic climate.Back in North Dakota, Marlyn Richter had told the visiting group of farmers andNatural Resources Conservation Service employees that farmers couldn’t be dummies. “Itused to be that all you needed for farming was a strong back,” he said. “It was okay tohave a weak mind. It’s not like that anymore.”Just as Richter, Brown, and the agriculturalists around Bismarck educate themselves67about soil health, so have these farmers in Western Australia. Wilson told me that becausefarming and ranching represent a smaller and smaller part of the GDP, the Australiangovernment has cut back on funding for the agriculture department. So the farmersthemselves have banded together into groups—Wilson is the head of one calledEvergreen Farming, which created a cheeky bumper sticker (one is now stuck to myrefrigerator) demanding SHOW US YOUR GRASS!—and seek funding for their ownfield trials. Four years after Wilson planted his perennial grasses, he and Wiley tested thesoil carbon content from the surface to 3 meters down. There was more carbon under theperennial grasses and tagasaste hedges than under the annual grasses—not surprising, asthe lack of tillage leaves intact the healthy soil communities and the perennial grasses andshrubs keep a growing root system in the ground year-round that feeds carbon sugars tothe microorganisms. Wiley wrote up a paper suggesting that perennial grasses might playa role in sequestering soil carbon and mitigating climate change and—citing some of thedata from Wilson’s property—submitted it to a Senate inquiry into climate change andagriculture. They were asked to join Christine Jones in making a presentation, as werenearly 20 other groups, in 2008.“Most of the other groups were talking about the problems that climate change wasgoing to cause for agriculture and how they needed money for research,” Wilson told me.“They were all doom and gloom. We were the only group who said we thought we couldsolve the problem.”Wilson pointed out the remains of the pits that were back-hoed to test the soil’scarbon—given his sandy soil, the carbon looked something like chocolate baked on to thetop of vanilla sponge cake—and showed me some of his new trials comparing differentorganic soil treatments. Then we roared off in his Land Cruiser to round up some escapedcattle, the Jack Russell perched on his right knee. Wilson leases 5,000 acres on this sanddune and grazes 1,000 cattle, some of which he sends to Israel, where they are fattened ina feedlot and then sold in Europe. We zoomed past the tagasaste, which looked somethinglike a formal hedge maze set in the middle of a pasture full of yellow daisies. As weneared the end of one field, Wilson stopped the truck and pointed at some creaturesbounding along a fence. “Emus,” he said with disdain. “Bloody stupid birds get caught inthe fences and break up the wire.” We passed through several paddocks—he moves hiscattle through a series of pastures so that they will graze Savory-style throughout the year—and finally found the breakaway bovines. Wilson chased them back with the LandCruiser, circling them and racing his engine when they dawdled. As Wilson succeeded inmaking one bull gallop away, a bull in another pasture yodeled with frustrated aggression.Back at the dining room table, Wilson and I were talking when his wife, Anne,interjected from the kitchen. “Are you going to tell her your dirty little secret?” she asked.He flushed, his sun-bleached eyebrows standing out even more than before in histanned face. “Yeahhh,” he said. “I no longer believe in climate change. That is, I believe68the climate is changing—since the mid-1970s, we’ve really been dealing with anotherclimate entirely here in Western Australia, where there’s less rain overall throughout theyear and more of that falls outside the growing season. But I don’t believe that humanactivity has caused this.”A climate skeptic! I listened with only faint surprise as Wilson told me about Websites he follows, like JoNova’s from Australia and Anthony Watts’s from the UnitedStates. He recalled things he’s read that make him doubt the climate alarms: that the“hockey stick” graph of rising global temperatures fails to mention a warming periodduring the Middle Ages, which suggests that climate swings have occurred naturallythroughout time. That ice core measurements show CO2 levels rising after temperaturehikes, not before, which suggests that atmospheric CO2 doesn’t promote warming.I wasn’t surprised by any of this, because people involved in agriculture are oftenskeptics of anthropogenically driven climate change. The American Farm Bureau is oneof the most vociferous groups challenging climate change in the United States and claimsthat 70 percent of American farmers share its stand. When I talked with David Miller, afarmer and the director of research and commodity services for the Iowa Farm Bureau,about rewarding farmers for the public good of soil carbon, we delved for a bit into theagricultural community’s feelings about global warming (I avoided talking about thescience). “There was trouble from the beginning with how it was presented,” he said.“There was the feeling that the scientists had been co-opted by the politicians and thataffected their credibility. The closer someone is to the land, there is the sense that we’vebeen through big cycles before. But that was absent from the global warming debate.What farmers understood was totally ignored or not addressed.”Bob Wilson was a believer when he testified to Parliament in 2008, but even thoughhe changed his mind, it still makes sense to him to do everything he can to build his soilcarbon and have the world take notice. First, he’s seen how the buildup of soil carbonunderneath his perennial grasses is helping the land hoard the rain falling on his sanddune, making it more productive and preventing erosion. That has downstream benefitsfor the environment around his land, too. And second, Australia may become the firstcountry to pay farmers for building up soil carbon as part of its effort to combat globalwarming. Wilson may be a skeptic, but he’s not about to turn down cash for this other“crop”—one that’s beneficial for his farm and for the public—that he’s been tending sovery carefully over the years.Beginning in 2012, under Australia’s Labor government, the Clean Energy Futureplan slapped a carbon tax of $23 per ton on the country’s greatest emitters—energyproviders, transportation companies, and other industries that churn out lots of greenhousegases—but does not go after agriculture, which is generally assumed to create 13 to 14percent of the world’s emissions.* In fact, the country’s Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI)offers agriculturalists a chance to claim some of these carbon-tax dollars with activities69that store carbon or reduce greenhouse gas emissions on farmland. When I was visitingAustralia in September of 2012, the only accepted method for biologically storing carbonwas to plant trees and pledge not to cut them down for 100 years. This rankled manyfarmers, who thought that it made no sense to turn working farmlands into forests whenone of the world’s other looming crises is feeding a population projected to grow to 9.6billion by 2050. Instead, they hoped that the CFI would expand the list of remuneratedcarbon-storage activities to include building soil carbon with better land management,which farmers around the world had already been calling carbon farming—at least since2006, when Vermont’s Abe Collins cofounded a company called Carbon Farmers ofAmerica.Carbon Farmers of America offered to sell credits called carbon sinks—a ton ofatmospheric carbon dioxide converted to about 545 pounds of carbon in the soil, newlyrelocated from the air to the soil by farmers—to anyone wanting to invest in soil renewaland perhaps offset their own carbon footprint. Collins’s group also envisioned amarketing plan to certify their products, ensuring customers that in addition to beingnutritious, their food was helping with the climate crisis. It ultimately wasn’t a workableplan, but it was an inspirational one.But when there’s a possibility of real dollars changing hands—“real” as in the $1.7billion from its carbon tax revenue that the Australian government planned to spend on itsCarbon Farming Initiative—figuring out payments for soil carbon sequestration has beenslow and controversial. Some of this has to do with the very opacity of the soil. No onedoubts that a growing tree removes carbon from the air and locks it up in a solid form:There it is, right in front of your eyes, whereas carbon in the soil remains hidden. Sinceunderstanding of the soil has generally lagged behind that of other ecosystems, convincingpolicy makers and others that the soil can absorb and hold carbon is a tough task.Since the benefits of building soil carbon are potentially huge—resulting in not onlymore productive farms, cleaner waterways, and overall healthier landscapes, but alsoglobal warming mitigation—some general rules have been developed to align thisbiological accounting with an economic one. Even when all parties agree that each ton ofcarbon stored in the soil is equivalent to about 3 tons of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere, any plan to reward activities that store carbon in the soil has to considerseveral factors to make that storage meaningful. First, the amount of carbon stored has tobe measurable in order to fit into an accounting system. Second, the activity that stores thecarbon has to be additional, meaning that the agriculturalist undertaking no-till or covercroppingis new to the practice—a condition that sadly leaves pioneers and earlyadaptors like Gabe Brown and Bob Wilson in the lurch. Third, the activity that builds soilcarbon can’t cause leakage, meaning that it can’t create a corresponding decrease in soilcarbon elsewhere. Say an agriculturalist undertook some sort of carbon-building practicethat made his or her land less productive, prompting another farmer or rancher to make upthe difference in supply using conventional methods that destroy soil carbon and release it70into the atmosphere—that would be leakage. In other words, there would be no overallincrease in soil carbon.Fourth, the carbon storage has to have a meaningful lifetime, an idea that has causedsome heated debate around the idea of permanence. For instance, a farmer might build upthe soil carbon on her land for 5 years, but if she sells the farm to someone who turns itinto a housing development, that accumulated carbon will puff away in the aftermath ofthe bulldozing. Even the most stable forms of soil carbon will break down in a few yearsafter they and their microbial and fungal communities have been sliced and diced, just asthe carbon stored in a tree is released into the atmosphere by fire. Reasonably, someonepaying for soil carbon sequestration wouldn’t want that to happen, but the fact is thatagricultural lands change hands.“Trying to fit in the idea of permanence makes the program unworkable,” DavidMiller told me. “A significant portion of agricultural land operates on one-yearrenewable leases. Our experience is that in a five-year period, about 17 to 20 percent ofthe land will change operators. That’s a lot of movement.”Difficult metrics to apply to a complex biological system where few things arepermanent! Even coal is not a permanent form of carbon storage, of course. Perhaps onlydiamonds are. But smart people around the world are working hard to develop elaborate,scientifically sound protocols—for either the voluntary or compliance markets—in whichsoil carbon storage and other forms of greenhouse gas mitigation can be verified andrewarded.The voluntary markets allow corporations and other entities that want to pleasecustomers and shareholders with some green action to buy credits from practitioners thateither reduce or prevent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or sequester soil carbon. Ahandful of nonprofits develop the protocols on which these credits are based, puttingtogether the best research from peer-reviewed studies on the effects of a certain practice,writing up comprehensive descriptions of what the land managers have to do, thenverifying every year to see if they’re are following the program. As of 2012, the voluntarymarket in the United States had issued more than $100 million in carbon credits.The compliance markets are driven by government regulation of greenhouse gases,which require large GHG-discharging entities to reduce their emissions or buy creditsthat offset their emissions. Significant compliance markets include California’s cap-andtradeprogram (which was just getting started in 2013) and the European Union’sEmissions Trading System. The California program has been taking protocols developedfor the voluntary market and fine-tuning them to fit the state’s regulation.Many progressive ranchers and farmers are stepping forward to help developprotocols. “They’re coming to the table,” explained Belinda Morris, formerly of theEnvironmental Defense Fund and the Nature Conservancy and now California director for71American Carbon Registry, a nonprofit that develops protocols for the voluntary markets,registers carbon projects, oversees verification by third parties that agriculturalists areactually preventing greenhouse gas emissions or building soil carbon, and issues creditsfor sale. “Many of them think they’re eventually going to be regulated anyway, and theywant to have a say,” she continued. “For instance, the California rice industry has beenworking on a methane reduction protocol with us because they think regulation will come,and they want to see it done right. They also want to be able to take advantage of newmarkets for additional revenue as opportunities arise.”Even outside the opportunities specific to global warming, healthy soil is becomingan item of interest. “There are a whole lot of groups out there that are doing sophisticatedanalysis on a large scale of the value of having healthy soils and healthy landscapes,”agricultural and natural resources economist Sara Scherr told me over the phone. “I thinkthat’s going to seep into policy and that people are going to become more aware of thecost of ignoring that kind of land management for a variety of ecosystem services.”“Ecosystem services” may sound like the name of a waste-management company, butthat’s the term used to trumpet the idea that healthy, carbon-rich soil is a win-win for justabout everyone (with the likely exception of Monsanto and other purveyors of GMO andchemical agriculture, should the regenerative model of agriculture prevail and turn theminto this century’s buggy whip manufacturers). I first heard Abe Collins speak at theQuivira Coalition’s conference in 2011, and he may be the nation’s most stirring voicearguing that soil carbon is the most basic and important life-supporting infrastructure onearth. He rattled off an impressive list of ills that healthy soil can cure. It not only keepswater in the soil, but also allows the microbes to gnaw away pollutants as this corralledwater slowly drips into streams and aquifers. That water storage mitigates flooding andwildfire, and the soil aggregates themselves prevent both water and wind erosion. Thatmeans fewer particulates dirtying up the air, so healthy soil brings cleaner air, too. Plus,healthy soil is highly productive soil. “This is an opportunity for farmers,” Collinsdeclared to the crowd. “We know how to build topsoil. We can fix land, not just preservethe degraded landscape that’s already in place.”I talked to Collins frequently by e-mail and phone over the next few years and finallyvisited him in Vermont the week following my trip to North Dakota. A few minutes after Ichecked into my hotel on my first evening, he knocked on my door and asked which Iwould prefer: resting up and meeting in the morning, or drinking gin and tonics on thebuddy seat of his tractor while he sprayed his fields with a mixture of liquefied fish andminerals.“And raw milk?” I asked. I knew he’d also taken to spraying the leftover skim milkfrom his dairy creamery operation—which doesn’t fetch much of a price—onto the fields.An extension agent in Nebraska named Terry Gompert and some farmers there found outthat the soil microbes love it. New insights like that spread quickly through the world of72regenerative agriculture.Collins shook his head. “No milk.” Then, “Sorry I smell like fish. But it’s good tospray this stuff right after it rains and in the dark.”I followed him out to the farm he was building as the green hills turned black andclouds curdled in the sky. Collins had a bar of sorts set up by a barn. He cut up somelimes on a rough board poised on sawhorses and poured Hendrick’s gin and some tonicinto two Mason jars, dubbed it a fine example of “Ginny Hendricks,” then left me to nursemine while he struggled with the rigging behind his red tractor. There were two smalllights on the front of the tractor and its fork was lifted, making it look like a lobster inattack mode. “I really appreciate the low-input way of farming, but sometimes you justhave to fire up the machine,” he shouted over the noise of the engine.Like Gabe Brown, Collins is another farmer who doesn’t come from a farmingfamily. He lived in the Hard Rock Chapter of the Navajo reservation in Arizona back inthe 1990s, working on a locally led project to harvest water and reclaim desertifiedlands. Young men were using techniques from permaculture, installing swales to harvestwater, plugging up gullies with gabions, and planting trees. Some of the older Navajostold him that their land was healthier when they were more nomadic, grazing their herdsand moving them on and not returning to the same spot until the grass grew back. Later, hewould hear that idea echoed in Savory’s belief that landscapes in brittle environmentsdepend for their health on intermittent but intense grazing by large herds behaving as theydid in the presence of predators.Collins returned to Vermont and began farming, putting what he’d learned out west towork. He was always as interested in soil health and overall landscape function as in thedaily challenge of keeping feed in front of his cattle. He read deeply into the agriculturalliterature—P.A. Yeomans, André Voisin, Sir Albert Howard, Robert Rodale, AllanSavory, Louis Bromfield, Friend Sykes, Newman Turner, and more—and talked withfarmers from around the world at conferences. He tried their grazing tweaks and some ofhis own to improve the farm. He realized he was making a real breakthrough when he dugsome postholes and found 16 inches of good black soil covering the blue Vermont clay,not the 8 inches he’d had the year before.While Collins wrestled with the rigging behind the red tractor, he talked about hisnewest way of making a living building soil carbon. He had created a business calledCollins Grazing that builds healthy farms from the soil up—since the primaryinfrastructure on a farm or ranch is the soil, every component therein has to contribute toits health—for clients with the capital to invest in tired farms. For instance, on the farm hewas building when I visited, they had invested in the lightweight electric fencing thatallows holistic grazers to create many small pastures and move their herd of cattle fromone to the next just by opening up a gap. One person and a few miles of electric fence canhandle a herd with as much finesse as Savory’s gang of herders. Through Collins, the73owners also invested in cattle, enough to affect the perfectly timed impact of manyanimals on the land. Typically, Collins’s customers can afford to wait until the land makesits transition from a depleted conventional farm to a carbon-rich, productive one.“I can build them a bunch of soil,” Collins said. “That’s a new business plan for me:creating turnkey farms from the soil up for my clients, working landscapes with the mostadvanced ideas from regenerative agriculture. This is expensive land, but it’s going totake a lot of work to get it to the point where they can make money on it.”Putting together boutique farms might be a good way for Collins to make a living, buthis vision for soil health is far from limited to these particular acres. As we talkedthroughout the next day, he explained that cities spend billions on downstream problemsfrom depleted landscapes. They have to put in infrastructure to avoid flooding, dig theagricultural erosion out of their ditches and waterways, and put their drinking waterthrough a maze of treatments to make it potable. “Paying land managers to rebuild soils isjust smart urban planning,” Collins said.Months later, he sent me the link to a Forbes.com blog post that made exactly thesame argument. In it, reporter Steve Zwick pointed out that by 2012, 200 cities in 29countries had decided to forego building new water treatment plants and reservoirs and,instead, invested in watershed restoration that reduced pollution downstream—double thenumber of such efforts in 2008. Zwick cited a report from Ecosystem Marketplace thatNew York City alone dodged spending $6 billion on a new filtration plant in the 1990s.Instead, the city employed a number of inexpensive strategies to improve the watersupply, including paying Catskill farmers upstream to change their land managementpractices in ways that reduced runoff on their properties and, ultimately, pollution in thelakes and streams that provided the city’s drinking water. Not only did this investment inupstream farmers save vast sums of taxpayer dollars, but this “natural” water purificationsystem continued to serve the citizens even when Hurricane Sandy roared ashore andzapped the electric power. According to Zwick, there are 67 similar programs in theUnited States. Worldwide, more than $8 billion is spent to improve watersheds’ naturalfunction in order to protect water quality downstream, with China spending 90 percent ofthose dollars.So every time Collins observes that his and other farmers’ management of the landhas resulted in healthier soil—with the attendant benefits of greater productivity, betterwater filtration, less erosion and runoff, and more biodiversity—he can’t help butimagine how the watershed would be impacted if a thousand other farmers were doingwhat he does. And he can’t help thinking about the urgent need to rebuild watersheds.“It’s a biological process of working with plants to turn air and water into the organicmatter that turns subsoil into living organic topsoil,” he told me. “How quickly can that bedone? I think the jury is out on that, so we need to monitor and be open to the outliers andthe anomalies”—like spraying raw milk. “But definitely, slow soil formation isn’t going74to get us out of the corner we’ve painted ourselves into. We need to regenerate it on apretty tight time frame.”Anyone expecting Collins to be some sort of nostalgic Luddite quickly has thatexpectation adjusted: He loves technology. For several years, he’s also been contributingto the development of a Web-based decisions-support tool for farmers that crowdsourcesinnovation and spreads it around the globe. “The burning of the libraries at Alexandria isconsidered a great historical loss of information,” he said. “But to me, there’s acomparable one happening every day, the loss of information generated on farms andranches. People uncover so much, there’s a spark and a flare and maybe someone writesit down. But information technology gives us the chance to link around the world.”Collins is also eager to see high-tech monitoring of working landscapes, an interestpiqued when he and his partners in Carbon Farmers of America needed to demonstratethe accrual of soil carbon on their lands. Such monitoring will not only give farmers andranchers another way to gauge the effectiveness of their land management, but alsodemonstrate that soil carbon can be increased to others who might need numbers to beconvinced.Soil carbon is typically tested by removing cores from within a plot, then drying andanalyzing them. There is one huge problem with this technique, and that problem hastriggered criticisms of the idea of paying agriculturalists to build soil carbon. Theproblem is that landscapes comprise huge variability—different concentrations of sand,clay, and silt, different topographies, different patterns of usage by humans and animals,different weathering—and the soil carbon content in one core may be quite different froma core taken 5 feet away. Even within one plot, the reading may vary up to 2 percentagepoints—a huge amount when you’re talking about soil carbon. Fifteen years ago, a soilscientist named Dan Rooney, who had specialized in graduate school on miniaturizinggeotechnical sensors, figured out how to combine proprietary sensors with software toaccurately map the soil properties of entire landscapes. “I can not only give someoneinformation on the way their soil is right now, but I can tell them what they can expect it tobecome given a certain kind of management,” Rooney told me. “That’s important, becauseit’s all about the site’s capacity to give us more.”Rooney’s technology is mostly used with high-value crops like grapes as well as inwhat’s called precision agriculture: large-scale operations that try to minimize the amountof irrigation and fertilizer a crop might need based on a detailed understanding of what’shappening in the soil. He’s used his technology in China, North Africa, Europe, and theUnited States, helping industrial agriculture be more efficient and less wasteful. But healso worked with Collins to get a baseline soil reading for what may be the world’s mostmonitored organic farm.The Innisfree Village farm is in the foothills of Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains and,since 1971, has been a home for adults with intellectual disabilities. Part of the village’s75founding mission—stemming from a belief that living on a healthy productive landscapeis good for people—is to conduct environmental research. In 2011, Innisfree hiredCollins and Rooney to do a carbon baseline on 62 of their 280 acres of pasture. Thecommunity was curious about how their management of the farm’s cattle, sheep, andchickens might be changing the soil. That bit of information made them hungry for evenmore data about the ways in which their land was changing. They discovered aworldwide “observatory” movement focused on sensing infrastructures that detectenvironmental change and then feed that information into software that aids analysis anddecision support.Innisfree farm manager Peter Traverse took the idea of turning the farm into anobservatory to private funders who are interested in healthy landscapes, and the InnisfreeObservatory was born. Along with the more common tools of farming, the staff theredeploys probes that detect volumetric moisture in the top 4 inches of the soil andpenetrometers that measure soil compaction, both of which are tied into a GPS system.They use iPads to take photographs and evaluate the amount of bare soil whenever theymove the cattle. They have a stream gauge that measures water quality as well as thevolume of water crossing the property via six streams, and a 3-D anemometer thatmonitors the wind. They’re also working with a scientist from Montana State Universityon developing a sensor that will monitor the ongoing carbon level in the soil.“We’re engaging the land in an active conversation,” said Traverse when I calledhim. “There are now ways to ask the land how it’s feeling. Of saying, ‘I just did this, andhow did it work?’ ”The goal of the Innisfree Observatory is to connect land managers like farmers withscientists, so that the scientists have a connection to an ongoing examination of howdifferent land management strategies play out on large tracts of land in real life—asopposed to on small research plots—and so that the farmers and ranchers learn to collectand publish data that’s of value to the scientists. All of this has been set up with the inputof a science board to ensure that when Innisfree Farm and the area farmers that join theobservatory collect and publish data, it will be considered to be of research quality byany scientist anywhere—not to mention useful to other farmers. The portal to the site wasbuilt by people from the University of California–Berkeley’s environmental engineeringdepartment.“We want legitimacy,” Traverse explained. “Most of us who are doing regenerativeagriculture really feel strongly that we are making a difference, but there’s a substantiallack of documentation to convince the rest of the world. Our project is trying to providean infrastructure that might allow that to happen.”Traverse expects that other farmers can one day avail themselves of some of thefancy sensors he’s got in place now. He believes they’re consistent with the classicobservational skills of farming, “I’m from a multigenerational farm family, and I really76enjoy watching my animals and the change on the landscape because I learn all the timefrom that,” he said. “I also like watching what my soil biology does and what the water isdoing. I couldn’t see that before, and neither could my father and grandfather.”The Innisfree Observatory is a great example of what Abe Collins wants to promote—high technology close to the soil—but he’s also involved in a very low-tech effort tomeasure the impact of land management on soil carbon. In 2011, he and several soilhealth advocates launched the Soil Carbon Challenge, described on its Web site as aninternational competition “to see how fast land managers can turn atmospheric carbon intosoil organic matter. . . . If you want to find out how fast a human can run 100 meters, doyou build a computer model, do a literature search, or convene a panel of experts onhuman physiology to make a prediction? No, you run a race. Or a series of them. There’sbeen tons of talk about soil carbon, but it’s time for motion: to show with good datawhat’s possible, and recognize those land managers who know how to increase soilcarbon.”For years, farmers and ranchers had been talking about the need for hard data toquantify the achievements of regenerative agriculture. The Soil Carbon Challenge wasfinally kicked off when a few of them attended a conference and heard a governmentscientist say that he didn’t think land management made much of a difference to soilcarbon storage and that it was too hard to measure the carbon accrual anyway. Organizersof the challenge suggest that it’s something like an “X Prize” for farmers and ranchers,although the award dollars come not from a billionaire but from fees paid by theparticipants. The hope is that this grand quantification will prod governments andinstitutions to develop incentives to encourage carbon-rich farming and grazing. Perhapsthis careful monitoring of change could even lead to soil carbon being at the heart of theUS farm bill and our public land policy. How much could the planet change if that kind ofofficial embrace were global?Such an audacious project, such a big idea! And sort of amusing, to me, that thearchitect and conductor of the Soil Carbon Challenge is one guy living in an old yellowschool bus.I went to visit Peter Donovan shortly after I moved to Portland in the fall of 2012,right around the due date for my second grandchild (in fact, I had to make sure a surrogategrandmother was around to watch baby number one if my daughter and her husband had tobolt to the hospital while I was out of town). Donovan had parked his bus at a farmoutside Philomath, Oregon, not far from where pigs lounged in the shade around open-airhutches in a large field and where a vigilant field marshal of a dog was driving sheepthrough a chute to be weighed. Pots of herbs soaked up the sunlight on the bus’s hood.Donovan had turned the inside into a comfortable living space fancied up by an uprightpiano bolted to the floor. At one point during our interview, he played me a thunderousclassical piece and I couldn’t help imagining him there at night, tinkling the ivories by star77shine, with only the pigs and sheep and wild creatures to listen.This makes Donovan sound like a hippie. But he’s somber, even severe looking, withshort gray hair and triangular black eyebrows and no-nonsense crinkles around his eyes.He has the gravity of a surgeon, but one who cuts his own hair.Donovan has committed to life on this bus for at least 10 years, which is also thelevel of commitment he expects from participants. At the beginning of the 10-year cycle,he takes a baseline soil carbon measurement from a spot on the property where the farmeror manager has not yet undertaken new management—say, no-till or holistic grazing orcover crops or any of the approximately 40 broad strategies that Abe Collins saysregenerative farming employs and adapts. The spot is always one that the farmer orrancher thinks has potential and has plans to begin new management there after themeasurement. Donovan will return every 3 years to take a new measurement. The projectis not intended to gauge the carbon increase over the entire property, as one would needto do to measure and sell credits for tons of carbon sequestered. Instead, he wants asnapshot of the kind of change that creative and dedicated land managers can make on soilcarbon levels.That 10 years is one of the things that sets Donovan’s effort apart from past soilcarbon measurement projects. Most academic research projects, he said, have to becompleted and reported within 3 years, which isn’t enough time to track what’shappening. And many estimates of how much carbon can be stored in the soil are done bycomparing different landscapes to one another: They measure the carbon in undisturbedforest soils, in soils that have been farmed for 20 years, in soils that have been farmed for10 years, and so on, then calculate how changes in any of these directions appear to haveaffected soil carbon levels. But by monitoring the change at multiple sites over 10 years,Donovan can really pinpoint the impact of human management on soil carbon.Most of the policy-level thinking about how to reward land managers for buildingsoil carbon is based on modeling. The longest-lived example was the Chicago ClimateExchange, which ran from 2003 to 2010, launched amid optimism that the United Stateswould adopt a national cap-and-trade program. The exchange based payment on models,basically saying that certain practices like no-till or manure spreading equaled a setamount of carbon stored in the ground. California’s cap-and-trade program has a similarapproach, although its protocols are far more rigorous, conservative, and science-based.But Donovan believes that modeling is basically wrongheaded. Actual monitoring—whether by the slow, low-tech painstaking method of taking many core samples andsending them to the lab or by a high-tech method like Dan Rooney’s or the kind of ongoingmeasurement happening at Innisfree—is the far better approach, he said. “Modeling offersa recipe and it limits the creativity of the land managers in the field,” he said. “You’re notgoing to get a guy like Gabe Brown”—who is participating in the challenge—“to do thestuff he does on the basis of paying for practices.”78Donovan took me out to a site where he had done a baseline measurement—a fieldwhere turf grass had once been grown and then sliced out for replanting into people’slawns. Since his measurement, the farmer had put in perennial grasses and was nowgrazing his sheep with holistic management. Ordinarily, setting up a grid of sample pointsand pulling soil cores takes Donovan 2 hours, but he quickly explained how he wentabout it, then used his handheld tool to pull a 4-inch deep core of soil from the earth. Hepointed to the yellowish bottom of the plug. “See how dry that is?” he said. “They’re notgetting enough water infiltration.”Then we hung around the bus for a while. This farm was not owned by the farmerwho worked there; rather, it was owned by a group called Farmland LP, which buys old,tired conventional farms and turns them into healthy organic ones. A tour of investors wason its way and I wanted to tag along, but they didn’t show up and didn’t show up andfinally, Donovan and I went to the farmers’ market in nearby Corvallis (and there, I foundthe apple of my dreams—Ashmead’s Kernel—and now have a tree growing in my yard).But I was interested in the concept, since it was another example of someone buildingsoil health and making money by doing so. When I caught up with Farmland LP’scofounder and chief scientist Jason Bradford on the phone, he explained that Farmland LPis a private equity fund that plans to take advantage of the gap between the supply anddemand of organic food. Sales of organic goods have grown by 20 percent per year since1990 and exceeded $28 billion in 2010. Even though organic goods are more expensive,the biggest limit to market growth is supply. Less than 1 percent of US farmland iscertified organic. That acreage was increasing at 8.5 percent per year until 2008, butcouldn’t catch up with the demand; now the number of organic acres is in decline. Muchof the demand for organic goods is satisfied by imports.“Management and finance has been the bottleneck,” Bradford told me. “There’s atransition period of about 3 years between conventional and organic, where costs go upand income goes down. After that point, organic farms tend to do better financially. If youwant to buy a car, you can get financing for five years. But right now, our system forfinancing in agriculture is short-term and pretty conservative.”Bradford saw that those 3 years of transition were a good target for finance,especially given that banks are leery of lending to organic farmers. He and his businesspartner, Craig Wichner, figured they could round up investors to supply the capital forland purchase and improvements. They would then be able to lease improved andcertified-organic farmland to smart young farmers who had some experience with goodfarming but not enough money to buy their own places. Bradford and Wichner envisionedfarms that would be not only certified organic, but also focused on soil health in a waythat most of the large-scale commercial organic operations do not. They started with 150acres in 2010 and now have 6,300 acres and 83 investors. “We tell our investors that theywon’t get their dividend payments for three years,” Bradford said. “It’s called patience79capital.”Like Abe Collins, Farmland LP is tapping into a relatively small pool of wealthypeople who think agriculture that builds healthy soil is not only a social good but also onethat can be profitable—the old doing-well-by-doing-good approach. But there areprobably not enough of that sort of wealthy person to save the 99 percent of USagriculture where land managers routinely destroy soil with poor practices. Who else canoffer them the incentive to change?We can, with the tax dollars that flow to the USDA. Founded in 1862 and signed intolaw by Abraham Lincoln—who called it “the people’s department”—the USDA is moreoften criticized than praised by good food and agriculture advocates. They cite therevolving door for the leadership of agribusinesses and the department, the USDA’s laxoversight of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), its paltry support of organic andlocal agriculture, and the ways it squashes small producers with rules intended to regulatehuge ones. As farmer and author Joel Salatin says in one of his books, Folks, This Ain’tNormal, “President Obama’s secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, was voted Governorof the Year by the transgenic-loving industrial agriculture sector when he was governor ofIowa. Is it any wonder he would approve transgenic alfalfa, more corn, and sugar beets?As of April 1, 2011, eighty-one transgenic crops have been approved by the USDA, andnot one single request has been denied. Who in their right mind thinks these people shouldbe in charge of food safety?”But the USDA is a huge organization with more than 100,000 employees, and manyare earnest strivers for agricultural policy that treats healthy soil as a public good. I metone of these employees who works out of Portland last year, and he explained how theUSDA is supplying public funds to help conventional farmers weather the transition to amore sustainable agriculture.Adam Chambers is a scientist with the USDA’s Natural Resources ConservationService (NRCS) and a farmer himself, with a small property back in Kentucky—in fact,he learned about the NRCS when he wanted advice for transitioning his land from thesingle species of grass planted by a previous owner to mixed perennial grasses thatwould enhance carbon sequestration on his land and offset his family’s carbon footprint,as well as provide a better habitat for bees and other pollinators. “I did it mostly thinkingabout the carbon, because I work on climate change science and policy, and I wanted towalk the walk.” he told me when I met him in the NRCS’s Portland office, sitting near awall of windows so dazzling with a view of the mountains that it was hard for me tofocus. “But the song sparrows don’t know that. The bobwhite quail don’t know that. Theturkeys that nest there don’t know that. The water quality in the Ohio River—that knowsnothing about carbon sequestration. These are public goods we’re getting from thisactivity.”Chambers is on the service’s Air Quality and Atmospheric Change Team, and he80works on its Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) program. Nine CIGs have protocolsthat either reduce greenhouse gases in agriculture or build soil carbon, provide farmersand ranchers with funds to make the transition, and then help them line up customers whowill buy carbon credits for the avoided or stored carbon.For one of these projects, the NCRS has partnered with Ducks Unlimited, avenerable organization of hunting enthusiasts that got its start during the Dust Bowl era—acatastrophic time for bird populations—and whose slogan is “Filling the skies withwaterfowl today, tomorrow, and forever.” Both the NRCS and Ducks Unlimited aredismayed by the amount of undisturbed land that’s being plowed up and planted withcommodity crops like corn, the price of which the ethanol market is driving the price skyhigh.This eliminates nesting and breeding grounds for wild water fowl and destroys soilcarbon. Fortunately, they’ve found a solution that pleases both conservationists andfarmers and rewards farmers at the same time.This CIG focuses on private lands in North Dakota that are part of the Prairie Potholeregion, where the land is packed with thousands of shallow wetlands. These lands havebeen sheltered by the Conservation Reserve Program (acronym overload: CRP), a federalprogram begun in 1985 to pay farmers and ranchers to voluntarily rest some of theirproperty from any form of production like row crops, grazing, or haying. Currently, some27 million acres nationally and 3 million in North Dakota are locked up in 10- to 15-yearCRP leases. The program isn’t purely a conservation initiative, although it does protectland from the plow. The USDA likes to have a supply of sheltered acres in case somenational emergency—such as the drought of 2012—threatens the nation’s supply of feedfor cattle. In those situations, the CRP lands can be grazed or mowed for hay.But as the CRP leases expire, many landowners are gravitating toward the allure ofhigh profits from commodity corn. So Ducks Unlimited and the NRCS have developed athird “working lands” alternative. In this scenario, landowners can choose to graze or haythe lands, but can’t till them for crops—thus preserving the carbon that’s been built up inthe soil. The landowners need to develop a sustainable grazing plan, and the NRCS willhelp fund the investments those plans require, such as fencing and water for the animals.And brilliantly, Ducks Unlimited has lined up a major American manufacturer that willbuy carbon credits from the landowners.For decades, environmentalists have been nearly united in their belief that cattle ruinthe land, but the science shows that waterfowl and cattle flourish in the same space. “Theduck–livestock connection is pretty basic,” explained Randal Dell, a Ducks Unlimitedbiologist (now working for the Nature Conservancy) whom I met in North Dakota. “Bothneed water or wetlands and grass. These Prairie Pothole wetlands are vital forwaterfowl, providing forage and habitat at key life history stages. And in the easternDakotas, where Ducks Unlimited focuses much of its work, we’re on the humid side ofthe Great Plains precipitation gradient. That additional precipitation and the plant81community it supports provide plenty of forage that is pretty resilient to grazing.”In fact, Dell pointed out in a follow-up e-mail that these mixed-grass prairiesevolved under the influence of bison and fire and require some disturbance to remainvibrant. He reminded me about how Gabe Brown’s holistically grazed fields looked somuch healthier than nearby CRP lands that had been ungrazed and undisturbed for years.The only catch to the new third alternative is that participants must agree not to plowand crop this land—forever. They have to encumber their descendents and future ownerswith preserving this land for grazing and haying, never crops—meaning that they willnever be able to reap the big ethanol bucks. However, what sounds like a stumbling blockisn’t, because landowners are scrambling to get into the program, Chambers said. NRCSset aside $1.5 million for the program in 2012, but there was $11 million in demand. “Thepublic benefits of this pretty modest investment are air quality, carbon sequestration,water quality, wildlife habitat, and soil health,” Adam Chambers told me. “And morepeople want to do it than we have public funds for.”While there’s no controversy that tilling the soil releases soil carbon, there is stilluncertainty in official quarters about whether land management can build soil carbon andby how much. Another CIG greenhouse gas project set in the Palouse—a beautiful area ofrolling hills in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington—addresses this issue. Formed of silt thatblew in from the west and cohered during the ice ages, the Palouse looks like miles of thekind of soft peaks you get when you beat egg whites, only very green. Wheat farmers haveprospered there for generations, tilling their fields over and over—sometimes makingeight passes with their equipment in a season. The soil carbon is not only gettingpulverized and released into the atmosphere, but the soil itself is also eroding and causingproblems in the watershed. Every time it rains, a torrent of chocolate milk–colored runoffpours from tilled fields into the streams. So NRCS has come up with a CIG thatencourages farmers to transition to no-till agriculture, paying them $22 per acre for 3years to help them with any extra costs or production losses. “It’s a risk hedge,”Chambers told me. “We actually think their production will gain.”The Palouse farmers will gain in another way, too. Scientists take a baseline soilcarbon measurement down to a meter on participants’ land and will measure again in 10years. The farmers receive payment immediately for the soil carbon they’re protectingfrom the ravages of tillage from EKO Asset Management Partners, a company that“invests in projects and companies that create environmental value.” At the end of the 10years, the Palouse farmers may also be paid for the amount of carbon they built in theirsoil over the decade. Several investment companies have expressed interest in buyingcarbon credits from the Palouse farmers in the future. In fact, the farmers will “grow”carbon just as they grow wheat: as a product they can take to market.All of this makes my head spin a bit, but Adam Chambers tells me to think of thecarbon credits as just another commodity—like an apple. EKO and the other investment82companies will buy these apples in bulk from the Palouse farmers and then, at some point,will probably turn around and sell them in the voluntary marketplace. As of this writing,only six protocols have been approved for the newest compliance market, the Californiacap-and-trade program, and none have anything to do with soil carbon. Following alongwith Chambers’s metaphor, that program is only interested in a very specific color, shape,and size of apple right now and is understandably leery of rotten ones. But there are hugeopportunities to sell these credits in the voluntary market, where companies—often at theinsistence of shareholders—are looking to boost their sustainability profiles.“There is a growing interest in agricultural carbon credits,” Chambers told me.“Purchasers seem particularly fond of the co-benefits associated with these credits.”Again, this CIG in the Palouse requires farmers to make a permanent transition to notill.And again, the response from farmers has far outstripped the public funds allocated tothe project.Imagine if soil health were a bigger priority for our government—a huge priority, onein which ample funding was available for all agriculturalists to transition to sustainableagriculture (which Peter Donovan describes as “ruining the land more slowly”) or, betteryet, to Gabe Brown–like regenerative agriculture! Adam Chambers calculates that of the914 million acres of farmland in the United States, only 4.3 percent is enrolled in somekind of government land conservation program. That leaves 875 million acres that couldbe enrolled in programs like the ones in North Dakota or the Palouse. Certainly, thepublic outlay would be immense, but the money saved on public health and on cleaning upour water, air, and the aftermath of climate-related disasters would dwarf the expenditure.Australia’s plan to pay farmers to store carbon or reduce greenhouse gas emissionsnot only eclipses national efforts in the United States monetarily, but in 2013 Australiaalso took the powerfully symbolic step of appointing one of its most eminent citizens asits first official advocate for soil health. Michael Jeffery is a career soldier who has since2003 been the country’s 24th governor-general, meaning he was appointed by the queen toserve as her representative in Australia. Ironically, his environmental philosophy derives,he told me, from Franklin Roosevelt, who signed soil-conservation legislation into law in1936 with the words. “The history of every Nation is eventually written in the way inwhich it cares for its soil.”Jeffery retired from the army in 1993 and then served as governer of WesternAustralia unil 2000. Upon leaving that post, he founded a nonprofit called Soils for Life,which encourages regenerative agriculture and collects case studies from farmers andranchers who have made the transition. In his new role as soil advocate, he’s insisting thatAustralia look upon its soil and water as its two primary strategic assets, which should bemanaged together. He wants farmers and ranchers to be rewarded for improving the healthof the landscape. And he’s challenging the nation’s scientists to study the attributes ofhealthy soil. “I want the scientists to give me the answer to a few simple fundamental83questions such that we can’t argue about them anymore,” Jeffery told me. “Carbonsequestration is one of the questions.”I visited several of the farmers whose case studies are on the Soils for Life Web site,plus several that weren’t. Most seemed doubtful that they’d ever be paid for the carbon inthe soil, but the other benefits made the transition worth it. Their soil now holds waterand minerals, and they’re making money from that. Their streams run clearer, theiranimals are healthier, and they’re tickled that scientists are now taking an interest in whatthey’re doing. Farming itself is now more interesting, more creative—an art and ascience, not a recipe.“We’re doing what we really love,” Rob Rex told me. He has a sheep and grain farmnear Wagin in Western Australia. “When we go into the local club and talk about farming,everyone else is all gloom and doom. But the people we meet on this trek are great. Youcan just see the energy in them.”# Chapter 6: Why Don’t We Know This Stuff?
When I took a seat on my first day at the 2010 Quivira Coalition conference, myfirst thought was that I had never been in a room with so many cowboy hats.Soon I was dazzled by more than headgear.In the morning, Doug Weatherbee from Dryland Solutions—he’s an Elaine Inghamprotégé, trained at her Soil FoodWeb center in Oregon—paced the front of the room todiscuss his work helping poor farmers in Mexico improve their yields without expensiveinputs like fertilizer, pesticides, and other chemical tools. He built a contour ditch systemat a test site to catch rainwater, then doused the soil and seedlings with compost tea, oneof Ingham’s favorite ways of ushering microbial life into depleted soil. (First, you have tomake good compost, which I later learned in a class with Ingham is a scientificallyprecise task—she is quite dismissive of the reduced waste or “putrescent slime” thatoften passes for compost.)Weatherbee’s before and after photos were stunning. A year after he began his work,Mexico suffered the worst drought in 60 years. Fields dried up all around the test site,which stood out like a green flag against a yellow backdrop. At Weatherbee’s site, thecornstalks often had three branches bearing ears, versus unbranched, single stalks withsolitary ears in the neighbor’s field. He suffered no corn borer worms, but they ravagedother fields. His ears of corn were voluptuous things with wild headdresses of red silk.The neighboring farmer—a very good farmer, Weatherbee said—had ears that looked liketiny dry pinecones.In the afternoon, a lanky Missouri rancher named Greg Judy loped to the front of theroom. He declared himself a microbe farmer and called his cattle mobile microbe tanks.He’d been “mob grazing” since 2007, which is a Savory-inspired approach that movesvery large herds of cattle over relatively small plots of land—for Judy, that meant about100,000 pounds of beef per acre. After one year, he had more forage (edible plants for thecattle), more earthworms, and better drought protection—his fields were still lush whenhis neighbors’ went dormant during a drought. He was so successful that he was able toquit his non-farm job. He expanded his operations by leasing nearby plots of land thatwere so depleted that no one bothered to farm them anymore. He marched his cattle upand down country roads to reach these other plots. They became so lush and filled withwildlife under his management that one hunting-enthusiast neighbor tore up the lease andinvited him to mob his cattle through—he hits each property about twice a year—inperpetuity.85Some of my favorite lines from Judy’s entertaining spiel:“Nature did it right for millions of years until we came and boogered things up.”“I don’t put hay out for my cattle anymore. You put a bale of hay out for a cow andyou turn her into a welfare recipient. My cows work for a living.”“Weeds are what Mother Nature lays down to protect her precious skin.”After Judy spoke, the audience moved outside and mobbed the cookies set out for ourafternoon snack. I saw that the man next to me wore a name tag saying that he was fromthe animal science department at California Polytechnic State University. I was eager tomeet more scientists focused on this approach, so I dropped my cookie in my pocket andthrust out my hand. “I guess you and the other scientists here do a lot of studies about thiskind of stuff,” I said, waving toward Greg Judy.To my surprise, Rob Rutherford, the animal scientist at the other end of my hand,shook his head. “We do almost nothing,” he said. “The farmers and ranchers are wayahead of the scientists on this.”A few months later, I asked the same question of David Zartman, an emeritusprofessor of animal sciences from Ohio State University. “There’s no one to pay for thiskind of research,” he explained. “A fertilizer company is not going to do it. A pesticidecompany is not going to do it. The money dictates the direction of the research, not theother way around.”I’ve always had fond feelings for ag scientists. I grew up not far from the Universityof California–Davis, which has one of the nation’s premier ag departments. When Imoved to Ohio, my father used to try to lure me back—he’d call and offer to pay mytuition at Davis and buy me a horse. At that point, I was more interested in Mao than moo,but the invitation always clutched at my heart a little. So it was a little disheartening tolearn that the corps of ag scientists—concentrated at the nation’s 105 land-grant universitycampuses—wasn’t hotly pursuing these exciting new ideas in agriculture.Really, some of these ideas aren’t even so new. Farmers have used cover crops forcenturies because they observed that their land was more productive if they grew somesort of plant after they harvested their main crop. They didn’t understand the complexinteractions between the sun and the atmosphere and the plants and the soil microbes thatscientists understand now; they just knew that it made them more successful. So how didsuch ideas manage to fall by the wayside? How did fertilizing our soils with the kind ofchemicals that nearly blew up the town of West, Texas, in the spring of 2013 become thenorm?Blame Abraham Lincoln, although it’s likely that he’d be dismayed by the state ofAmerican agriculture, too.Lincoln grew up in rural hardship. As Ricardo Salvador, the director and senior86scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Food and Environment Program, told me,“He spent a lot of time on the sharp end of a team of horses, endured drudgery, and reallywondered for hours on end whether there was a better way.” When he became president,Lincoln set up a research apparatus that would look for that better way. He established theNational Academy of Sciences. He formed the Department of Agriculture. He signed abill proposed by Vermont senator Justin Smith Morrill to set up a network of colleges thatwould focus on agricultural research and education. President James Buchanan hadvetoed the bill—it had also been hotly opposed by representatives from the South—butLincoln signed it into law in 1862. The law authorized the federal government to deedsome lands to each state and territory for these colleges, most of them now universities.Federal and state funds have helped support these land-grant institutions ever since.In an address delivered in 1931, W.J. Kerr, the president of Oregon StateAgricultural College, praised the formation of land-grant colleges for bringingdemocratized education and an understanding of science to an ignorant country. He said:The people generally knew little about science or the applications of science.The common attitude toward applied science was expressed in a New Englandnewspaper of 1816, in opposition to a plan for street lighting, by such statementsas these: “Artificial lighting is an attempt to interfere with the divine plan of theworld, which called for dark during the night time.” “Emanations of illuminatinggas are injurious.” “Lighted streets will incline people to remain outdoors, thusleading to increase of ailments by colds.” “The fear of darkness will vanish, anddrunkenness and depravity increase.”Later in his address, Kerr cataloged the contributions of the land-grant colleges toAmerican agriculture, noting that their work had resulted in the development of wholenew industries. All told, he said, the land-grant colleges’ contribution to the economicwelfare of the country was around $1 billion per year.Thousands of acres in northern Indiana, formerly unproductive and abandoned byfarmers, have been reclaimed for productive agriculture as a result of researchesin soils and crops at Purdue. Introduction of new varieties of cane saved theLouisiana sugar cane industry from ruin caused by the mosaic diseases affectingold varieties. Feterita, introduced from Egypt into Texas, has developed into afodder crop valued at $16,000,000 annually. Grimm alfalfa, brought to thiscountry by a German immigrant whose name it bears, and demonstrated as hardyand adaptable by repeated trials at Minnesota, has replaced the ordinaryvarieties in the major alfalfa-producing sections of the country. Among newwheat varieties developed by land-grant colleges, such as Kanred, Denton,Federation, and Defiance, Denton alone in Texas has increased the agriculturalwealth of the state at the rate of $2,500,000 a year. In Missouri an industrytotaling $15,000,000 a year has developed from the introduction by the land-87grant college of the soy-bean, a crop that was formerly practically unknown.Prompt control of the cotton boll weevil, the European corn borer, and theMediterranean fruit fly, saved from ruin the major industries of growing cotton,corn, and citrus fruits. Improved production methods and greatly reducedproduction costs resulting largely from research, have led to the development ofdairy production into a $2,750,000,000 industry. Breeding for egg production inOregon, the evolution of the trapnest by the Maine station and the day-old-chickenterprise originated at the New Jersey station, have together revolutionized thepoultry industry. The peach industry of the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakesregions, and the entire apple industry of the United States, exist today ascommercial enterprises because the land-grant colleges have been successful indevising methods of controlling diseases and insect pests.From the vantage point of 1931—and even looking back from 2013—Lincoln’sefforts to boost agriculture and the system that evolved around those efforts have been amassive success. “We licked productivity,” Salvador told me. “In Lincoln’s time, youreally could starve if the crops didn’t turn out that year. Now, none of us worries whereour food is going to come from. There’s never been as much food as there is now, andwhen we think about it, it’s mostly about convenience and what we’re going to have. Eventhose who worry about food don’t really worry about food. They worry about whetherthey have the money to buy the food. The food is not the question.”But tucked into all this energetic tinkering with agriculture was the dangerous ideathat humans had a mission to conquer nature for their needs. It’s an idea that rose from theEnlightenment, says Fred Kirschenmann, the former director and now a distinguishedfellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University.“The Enlightenment freed us from what we call the Dark Ages and from theideologies that had locked us in,” Kirschenmann told me. “But a part of thatEnlightenment vision was that we humans were somehow separate from nature, that wecould not only dominate it but had a responsibility to do so. René Descartes oncefamously said that we had become the masters and possessors of nature. There was anassumption that nature was this collection of materials that we could manipulate for oursole benefit. There was no awareness that nature actually was a living community that’svery interdependent.”The catastrophic apex of this kind of thinking thundered across the High Plains just afew years after Kerr’s remarks. Sodbusters eager for big profits growing wheat ripped upvirgin prairie soil and planted their crops over and over again, without giving anythingback to the land—no cover crops, no mulch, just relentless plowing. Without vegetation tonourish the soil and hold it in place, the land baked and bleached and dried. When theonslaught of plows coincided with a long hot spell and high winds, the Dust Bowl wasborn.88Timothy Egan captured the Dust Bowl masterfully in his book The Worst Hard Time.“Dust clouds boiled up, ten thousand feet or more in the sky, and rolled like movingmountains—a force of their own,” Egan writes. “When the dust fell, it penetratedeverything: hair, nose, throat, kitchen, bedroom, well. A scoop shovel was needed just toclean the house in the morning. The eeriest thing was the darkness. People tied themselvesto ropes before going to a barn just a few hundred feet away, like a walk in space,tethered to the life support center.”When the dust mountains rumbled to the east with a storm in May 1934, the rest of thecountry had to take notice of this environmental disaster on the Great Plains. “In Chicago,twelve million tons of dust fell,” Egan reports. “New York, Washington—even ships atsea, 300 miles off the Atlantic coast—were blanketed in brown.”Mother Nature made her point about the perils of ruining the soil, and we took heed,at least for a while. Just a few weeks after a second cloud of Great Plains dust blackenedthe midday skies in Washington, DC, a rattled Congress passed the Soil Conservation Actof 1935. The law recognized that “the wastage of soil and moisture resources on farm,grazing, and forest lands . . . is a menace to the national welfare,” and it directed thesecretary of agriculture to establish the Soil Conservation Service as a permanent agency—it is now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Two years later,President Roosevelt authorized the creation of soil conservation districts throughout thecountry, and 3,000 of them operate today. Egan believes that the work done by thesedistricts changed practices in the Great Plains such that despite two more significantdroughts, Dust Bowl II never arrived.Not to say that the dust storms have stopped completely. The first time I googled“dust storm” a few years ago, a citation popped up for one that had just happened 2 weeksbefore. I just googled it again, right now, and found a January 2013 article about dust fromeast-central Colorado that blew into northwest Kansas and reduced visibility to a quartermile, causing hazardous conditions for an hour.In addition to changes in public policy, the Dust Bowl prompted a sort of agrarianrenaissance in which people rethought not only the way they treated the land, but alsotheir overall relationship to it. “Do civilizations fail because soils fail or do soils failbecause civilizations don’t know how to take care of the ground beneath their feet?” Thatsounds like something Elaine Ingham or Gabe Brown or Allan Savory might say, but it’s aquote from the USDA’s 1938 Soils and Men: A Yearbook in Agriculture.One of the most prominent suitors of the soil was Louis Bromfield, a Pulitzer Prize–winning author and Hollywood hobnobber. He returned to Pleasant Valley in Ohio after13 years in France to spend the last part of his life restoring the soil on eroded land nearthe family farm where he grew up. He wrote two books of short stories and five novels inOhio, but none were critically acclaimed—in fact, Edmund Wilson titled a fierce reviewof one of his books “What Became of Louis Bromfield” in the New Yorker. But at this89point, Bromfield was only writing fiction to support his work on the farm. When hestarted writing nonfiction about that experience, the critics once again applauded.Bromfield couldn’t benefit from the kind of soil science available to today’sinnovative farmers, as studying soil health and belowground biology is a fairly recentphenomenon—in fact, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) soil scientist Doug Karlentold me that when he offered to do a workshop on soil health at the Soil Science Societyof America’s annual convention 15 years ago, some members of the society sneered thatsoil health wasn’t science. But Bromfield was a careful observer and tried to work withnatural processes instead of trying to circumvent or battle them, as a growing number of“modern” agricultural experts were urging. He initiated careful cropping and grazingstrategies, with splendid results. Abe Collins is something of a scholar of the agrarianrenaissance of the 1930s and 1940s; his e-mails trail a long list of quotations from soilbuildingpioneers like Bromfield. “Experts say it takes nature 1,000 years to make an inchof soil,” Collins told me. “But Louie was building one to two inches of soil in a year andchanging the soil profile at depth. He bought worn-out farms and had a foot of reallyfertile soil in ten years.”My last foray into the Ohio countryside before I moved to Portland was toBromfield’s Malabar Farm, now a state park just a few miles from the interstate. Cornwas lined up like thousands of soldiers in battle formation on both sides of the road, cowswere eating hay in a muddy paddock—the place didn’t scream enlightened farming. Asidefrom his books, which continue to inspire people like Abe Collins, Bromfield’s onlyenduring legacy is the 32-room house he built for his family and guests, and his hugecollection of books and art. I joined a crowd of visitors with fidgety, unimpressedchildren for the house tour, marveling with a trio of librarians over the Grandma Mosespaintings and the framed New Yorker cartoons that referred to Bromfield. I gaped at thestaircase where Lauren Bacall tossed down her bridal bouquet to the gang of friends whowent rustic for her wedding to Humphrey Bogart. And I coveted Bromfield’s amazingbedroom, with his huge writing desk and a bed built into a bookcase and walls paintedgreen and red. I was sure that the illustrator for Goodnight Moon must have spent sometime there.Fortunately, another urban defector from the 1940s had a more lasting and profoundeffect on America’s appreciation for the soil. J.I. Rodale—born Jerome Irving Cohen—started life in the Lower East Side of New York, where he was the sickly son of a grocer.He moved through a number of careers before he encountered Sir Albert Howard’s book,An Agricultural Testament, in which Howard describes his years as an agriculturalexpert in India from 1905 to 1931, where he discovered more wisdom in the practices oflocal farmers than in the practices he had brought from England. Howard became achampion of building soil health and developed a method of composting waste materialsinto powerful soil amendments. Rodale bought a farm to practice Howard’s methods andbecame the first person to popularize the organic approach in America. When Rodale90launched his first magazine in 1942, Organic Farming and Gardening, Howard was anassociate editor.Rodale sent out 10,000 free copies of his first issue to farmers, but they weren’t areceptive audience back then; not one subscribed to the magazine. Thirty years later, anarticle about Rodale titled “Guru of the Organic Food Cult” in the New York TimesMagazine reflected that “chemical fertilizers are considerably easier to apply than bulkyorganic matter and tend to provide larger yields during routine applications. J.I. wasspreading his gospel at the start of a full gallop in the American farmer’s movementtoward chemical fertilizers; their use in the U.S. has increased sevenfold since 1940.”But Rodale persevered. By the time the Times article came out, he and his work werehugely influential among an array of subcultures. The Times writer tagged them as “foodcultists from old-line vegetarians to youthful Orient-inspired ‘macrobiotic’ dieters withtheir emphasis on whole grains, especially rice, plus reactionaries yearning to turn backall clocks, urban dropouts in search of simpler, more natural life styles, ecologists whoare worried about the long-range environmental effects of some chemicals, Dr.Strangelove paranoids who read poison plots on the ingredient labels of pancakes mixesand increasingly, rather ordinary folk to whom pronouncements about the perils ofcyclamates, phosphates, etc., have stirred a wariness about all man-made chemicals,particularly those that get into their food, or that they think do.”I number myself among the Drs. Strangelove.The Times article portrays J.I. as a somewhat endearing crackpot, but, really, somany of his concerns were incredibly prescient. As proof of Rodale’s kookiness, theTimes writer points out that he considered wheat, sugar, and fluoride in drinking water tobe unhealthy, but those are quite mainstream concerns now. When the writer asked why—if organic agriculture was so superior—it hadn’t been more widely adopted, J.I.complained that the entire agricultural establishment, from the land-grant universities andacademic agriculture to the Department of Agriculture, was held in thrall by the profitagenda of agribusiness. Plenty of people share that view today! I heard a similar twist onthat argument from a prominent physician a few years ago when I was writing an articleabout gluten-free diets. He told me that celiac disease, in which the gluten in wheat andother grains actually damages the digestive architecture of affected people and can causeprecancerous conditions, was hugely under diagnosed in the United States compared toother nations. Why? I asked. He thought that the disease attracted few research dollarsbecause Big Pharma didn’t see a money pool there, since the best treatment wasn’t drugsbut simply to avoid glutenous foods.J.I. turned his attention to writing plays in his later years, and his son Robert tookover the family enterprise. Like his father, he bent ears hither and yon about thesuperiority of agriculture that worked with nature; as they had with his father, manypeople shrugged and turned away. On a trip to Washington, DC, in the late 1970s, he met91with lawmakers to try to win public policy considerations for organic agriculture. Theresponse was “Come back when you have the research to back your claims that this is abetter or even credible approach.” So Robert Rodale headed back to the Rodale Institutein Kutztown, Pennsylvania, and, with an agronomist named Richard Harwood, designed aside-by-side trial of organic versus conventional farming. The trial continues today and isthe oldest such experiment in the United States and the second oldest in the world.The Farming Systems Trial (FST) marked its 30th anniversary in 2011. Thefollowing spring, I drove from Cleveland to Kutztown to meet with Jeff Moyer, who’sworked on the trial from the very beginning and is now the Rodale Institute’s farmmanager. We clomped from his office toward the test fields, passing several cylindricalcompost piles at the heart of the campus that steamed like giant cups of coffee—as themicrobes eat, work, and reproduce, they build up a lot of heat. The test fields themselveswere pretty unremarkable looking—nothing much was growing—but it was clear thatneither the organic nor the conventional plots had any sort of topographic advantage, asthey alternated in 5-foot strips for 100 feet across the landscape.The organic strips employ the basic three tools of organic agriculture—the “threeCs,” as Moyer called them: a top dressing of good compost, nitrogen-grabbing legumecover crops during fallow periods, and crop rotation. The thinking behind the latter is thatwhen you plant the same crop in the same field every year, the diseases and pests thatprey on that crop take up residence there, too; if you move the crop every year, then youdon’t have to fight so much with the diseases and pests. Good organic farming isn’t justthe absence of synthetic chemicals, Moyer explained, but rather an approach that workswith biological processes and regards the soil as a complex system of living organisms.“We don’t talk about soil quality anymore,” he said. “We talk about soil health. It seemslike a game of semantics, but I think it’s important. I can have a high-quality table, forinstance, but I can’t have a healthy table.”The FST has involved many partnerships with USDA and other scientists, andinspired many master’s theses and dissertations—Moyer guesses the number as 40. Thetrial only compares corn and soybeans, since about half the cropland in the United Statesinvolves those two plants and that’s where the benefits of organic could have a hugeimpact on our land, water, and rural livelihoods. Over the years, the Rodale Institute haschanged certain aspects of the trial so that it fairly represents the differences betweenmodern organic and conventional agriculture. For instance, conservation requirements inthe 1985 farm bill pushed many otherwise conventional farmers to go no-till, so the FSTsplit its conventional plots into till and no-till to account for that change. And since 94percent of all soybeans and 72 percent of all corn grown in the United States are nowgenetically modified to either resist the effects of herbicide or to produce their ownpesticides, the FST incorporated those varieties into the conventional plots.Looking back over 30 years, the results are a resounding endorsement for organic.92The organic plots built soil carbon, while the conventional plots depleted it. After thefirst 3 years of transition, the organic plots and the conventional plots produced the sameamounts of food, except during drought years—and then, the organic yields were 31percent higher. The organic corn and soybeans survived weedy encroachments better thanthe conventional crops—a huge issue, since the herbicide-resistant genetically modifiedcrops are so heavily sprayed with Roundup and other glyphosate-based weed killers thatthe practice is creating swaths of superweeds that are resistant to herbicides. At lastcount, there were 197 such superweeds. And finally, the organic systems were nearlythree times as profitable as the conventional systems, because they are produced withoutcostly chemicals and consumers are willing to pay more for them.Scoffers would scoff, saying things like “Sure, what do you expect Rodale’s tests toprove?”—despite the fact that Rodale has partnered with many outside scientists on thetrials, including Matt Ryan from Cornell University, Michelle Wander from the Universityof Illinois, and David Douds from the USDA’s lab in Philadelphia. But otherorganizations have conducted studies that come to the same conclusions. A report from theUnited Nations noted that “Organic agriculture has the potential to secure a global foodsupply, just as conventional agriculture is today, but with reduced environmental impact.”A study from Iowa also found that organic systems for corn and soybeans produced aboutas much food as conventional systems over 12 years. A study from the University ofMinnesota showed that farmers who use genetically modified crops made less moneyover a 14-year period—the seeds and chemicals that they’re engineered to work with areexpensive and make profit margins wither.All of this raises questions: Why don’t we know about any of this stuff? Why is it thatpeople who set out to practice high-knowledge, low-technology, soil-cherishingagriculture are dismissed as either nostalgic Luddites or elitists who only care aboutfeeding people who can pay a premium for boutique food? Why is it that even people whoshudder at the damage conventional agriculture does to the environment conclude that thiskind of agriculture is a necessary evil if we’re going to feed 9.6 billion people by 2050?“People frame us as being anti-modernity or anti-progress because they equate thenew technologies with progress,” Ricardo Salvador told me. “And when we talk aboutcover crops and integrated pest management and polycultural systems and crop rotation,that sounds suspiciously like the kind of agriculture that was practiced in the past. Butthere’s a sophistication and real progress that comes from taking what we know aboutbiological systems and applying it. We could be far more efficient in our agriculture if weonly applied this approach, but of course there’s no profit other than to the farmersthemselves, and those that would benefit directly when the farmers benefit.”That would be us, the consumers.I went to a conference of food and science writers a few years ago where an array ofspeakers held forth on an array of food-related topics. The title of one speaker’s talk was93“The Culture War in Food and Farming: Who Is Winning?” I listened with interest at first,then with growing umbrage. Who favored organic agriculture? the speaker asked, and thenanswered his own question. Not economists or scientists or the public, he said. Rather, itwas the cultural elite like Michael Pollan and Barbara Kingsolver.That didn’t sound right. By this time, I had spoken to many scientists who wereinterested in alternative agriculture and who talked about how hard it was to get fundingfor anything other than projects that fall within conventional agriculture’s bailiwick. Iknew plenty of ordinary people who wanted more wholesome food; I was delighted whenI’d see shoppers at my farmers’ market buying organic produce using public assistancecards. I thought that was a damned good use of my tax dollars. So I Googled the guy whilehe was talking and found that he had served as a consultant to the leadership of Monsanto.I raised my hand, stood, and said all of that. He approached me after he finished speakingto tell me that he was never paid by Monsanto. Was it better that he had worked for themfor free?The sad fact is that the system that Lincoln set up to create better agriculture nowlargely serves agribusiness, instead of the individual and everyman farmers and the nationof eaters whom he wanted to help. And it’s the agribusiness narrative that’s upheld, nomatter how much proof emerges that there is another approach to agriculture that will notonly stop destroying our environment, but also heal it. Not only does Big Ag keep tellingus that we need to adhere to their agenda, they keep telling us we need more of it.“We still operate out of the cultural meme that we humans are superior to everythingelse in nature, that we’re the big-brain mammals and that we can always come up with thetechnology that’s going to be superior to anything nature does,” Fred Kirschenmann toldme. “That’s really behind the question that is posed so often in the popular press: ‘Howare we going to feed 9 billion people?’ The assumption is that we just have to push thepedal to the metal a little harder and figure out the new technologies that make thathappen.”The specter of 9 billion gaping, hungry mouths is worrisome, of course—there arealready almost a billion people struggling to get enough to eat, and who wants to see thatnumber grow? But careful observers say this image is actually just a club crafted andwielded by agribusiness to scare us into supporting their agenda. We already grow morethan enough food for 9 billion people, according to calculations done by the MillenniumInstitute. Global agriculture currently produces 4,600 calories for every man, woman, andchild on earth—twice as much as we need to thrive. The problem is not one ofproduction, but of distribution.“The loss of food from retail on is huge,” said Hans Herren, an agronomist who ispresident and CEO of the Millennium Institute and was one of the editors of the UN’sglobal report “Agriculture at a Crossroads.” “In the developed world, people throw awaymore than 30 percent of their food after they buy it. The price is so low that they don’t94value it.”The narrative from the Farming Systems Trial and from innovative farmers who havelargely left chemical, conventional agriculture behind challenges powerful vestedinterests. Even individual farmers caught up in conventional agriculture resist thenarrative from regenerative agriculture because they have made such huge investments inthe current system. Back in the 1970s, Earl Butz, head of the USDA under Richard Nixonand Gerald Ford, roamed the country urging farmers to take on debt so that they couldgrow their businesses and produce for the global market. “Plant fencerow to fencerow”and “Get big or get out!” were two signature Butz bellows. So farmers followed theadvice the USDA and the academicians pressed on them, plowing up more land andbuying expensive machinery—when you see a John Deere combine churning down afield, that alone is a nearly half-million dollar investment—and charging after short-termprofits.“When you put yourself in that position, what are you going to do?” FredKirschenmann told me. “You’re going to do everything you can to keep the current systemgoing, because you’re over 60 now and that’s what you’ve invested in.”Laura Jackson, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Northern Iowa,describes the agriculture that has resulted from the Butz revolution as a giant open-airfactory owned by monopolies and stretching across the Midwest. You can drive for 6hours and see nothing but corn and soybeans, and before and after these annual crops areplanted and harvested—a period of about 9 months—the ground is naked and exposed tothe elements. This is agriculture, but we don’t eat what it produces. The corn andsoybeans are commodities that feed cattle and other animals in feedlots, supplymanufacturers making high fructose corn syrup and other food additives, and provide theraw material to ethanol makers.Jackson suggests that the allegiance on the part of conventional farmers to this kind ofagriculture is an example of Stockholm syndrome. “If you become a captive and begin tolook at your captors as friends and allies instead of what they are—kidnappers—then yousuffer from Stockholm syndrome,” she said in a speech. “In the pressure to comply withthe demands of your kidnappers, you forget who you are, who your real friends are, andwho your family is. . . . Our high-energy corn and bean system is a kidnapper, not ourfriend, even though we may have to get along with it for the time being because it’s all wehave.”Thirty years of concentration and consolidation in agribusiness—in meatpacking,seeds and chemicals, grain handling and shipping, farm equipment, fertilizers, and foodretailing—has allowed these industries to winnow down the opportunities for farmers tojust a few. The seed industry is a good example. Neil Harl, an emeritus professor ofagriculture and economics at Iowa State University, wrote a brief to the Department ofJustice recommending antitrust action against the seed and agricultural chemical industry,95noting that farmers could choose from among 300 suppliers of corn seed in the 1970s. Thecompetition among these suppliers kept seed prices affordable.This changed with the advent of agricultural biotechnology and laboratorymanipulatedgenetic material. The United States Patent Office had never favored thepatenting of life forms and turned down a patent for a microorganism that ate oil spills.But the US Court of Customs and Patent Appeals overturned the case, and the SupremeCourt upheld that decision in 1980, ruling in Diamond v. Chakrabarty that a life-formcould be patented. A little more than 20 years later, the Supreme Court ruled that seeds,too, could be patented. For the first time, farmers were prohibited from saving seed fromthese patented biotech crops to replant the following year.The technology to create these new bio-tinkered seeds is expensive, and the numberof seed suppliers dwindled rapidly to the handful of big firms that could afford it. Now,Monsanto controls 30 to 40 percent of the market directly, creating seeds that—in the caseof Roundup-ready crops that resist herbicides—are designed to coexist with largeamounts of Monsanto chemicals to perform as advertised. Harl estimates that Monsantoactually influences pricing for 90 percent of corn and soybeans seeds, since they also sellbiotech traits to competitors. Given Monsanto’s control of the market, it is not surprisingthat the price of seeds for farmers has skyrocketed: Prices rose 150 percent between 1999and 2010. Some farmers are able to absorb the higher costs, but many marginal producershave been driven out of business.Harl is a tenacious advocate for antitrust action against agribusiness, but he’s notoptimistic that without pressure from consumers, the government will go after these hugemonopolies that control our food. “There’s a huge amount of money and a lot of pressureapplied whenever someone in Washington tries to do something about this,” he told me.“That pressure is applied in the form of messages like ‘Look, if you let this go on, we’regoing to diminish our support for your campaign.’ When things get bad enough thatconsumers rise up, that’s when we’ll get another era of antitrust.”How much money is involved? The Center for Responsive Politics reports thatduring the past 2 decades, the agriculture sector contributed $480.5 million to nationalpolitical campaigns. In 2009, the sector spent $133 million on lobbying. This was nearlyas much as the nation’s defense contractors spent that year, but way below the $385.9million that the energy sector forked over in 2008.The government not only won’t go after Big Ag, but also uses our tax dollars tosupport agribusiness and the system of ruinous agriculture it has created. “It’s the mostperverse way you could set up a civilization, where you’re paying the farmers to degradetheir underlying resource,” Abe Collins told me in one of our early conversations. Hemeant that through the farm bill, which has been redrafted in various ways since the GreatDepression and has been revised about every 5 years since 1973, we as taxpayers rewardfarmers for practicing the kind of agriculture that depletes soil—at a cost of $95 billion96annually. It took me a while to understand the mechanism for this, since US agriculturepolicy is so complex—really, I wanted to find a “Farm Bill for Complete Idiots” book tobreak it down for me. Fortunately, I discovered the Web site of Harvest Public Media,which reports on “food, fuel, and field,” where an article by Kathleen Masterson offereda lucid explanation of the history and current state of government payments to farmers.Until 1996, the government gave crop subsidies to the nation’s farmers. The practicebegan during the Great Depression to help farmers stay in business, because their incomefell off precipitously whenever food prices dropped due to overproduction. The subsidiespaid farmers to leave some land fallow to avoid glut. The government also bought excessgrain, which it stored and later released during times of need.Grain prices were high in the mid-1990s, prompting the architects of the 1996 farmbill to announce provisions that would reduce and eventually eliminate subsidies. Butwhen prices fell once again, new government programs were quickly crafted to keepfarmers in business. One program sent farmers direct payments based on the number ofacres they had farmed in the 1980s, regardless of market conditions. Anotherautomatically sent farmers a check when prices dropped. The payout soared even higher.American farmers received more than they ever had: $20 billion annually from 1999 to2001.The consequence of these government programs was that farmers planted more crops,since the more acres they farmed, the higher their government check would be. “I think thenet effect was farm consolidation, concentration and a decline in opportunities for newfarmers to get started,” Ferd Hoefner of the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalitiontold Masterson. “There were lots of reasons why farms got bigger and fewer in numberand certainly technology played a big role, but policy certainly has contributed to that.”As is so often the case, these government programs that were supposedly intended tohelp all farmers disproportionately helped the very richest ones—those with vastacreages who produced the five major commodity crops of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton,and rice. From Masterson’s article: “According to the Environmental Working Group’scrunching of U.S. Department of Agriculture numbers, between 1995 and 2010 threequartersof farm subsidy dollars go to the top 10 percent of those who receive subsidies.About 62 percent of American farmers don’t receive any subsidies at all, according to2007 data.” Many of these farmers are raising fruits, vegetables, and nuts that aren’tcovered by subsidies. Ironically, they’re producing food that we actually eat as opposedto the crops that enter the juggernaut of agricultural processing and emerge, for the mostpart, as nonedible products. Even some farmers producing commodity crops don’t getsubsidies because they’re working acres that weren’t mapped when the subsidy programswere set up.The 1996 farm bill contained two other major changes. It required farmers topurchase crop insurance that was heavily subsidized by the government to be eligible for97farm payments, and it ended the requirement that they engage in conservation practices inorder to be insured. Enrollment in crop insurance was swift and heavy, and farmersreceived nearly as much federal assistance from insurance payoffs as from the directpayments. Total payments to farmers in 2012 were $20.45 billion.High as it is, that figure doesn’t reveal the full flow of taxpayer dollars underwritingindustrial agriculture. According to a 2004 study by agricultural economists MichaelDuffy and Erin Tegtmeier at Iowa State University, the government was spending another$5 to $16 billion per year to mitigate some of its damage to our environment; the costs arelikely to be significantly higher now. “Industrial agriculture only stands up economicallybecause we don’t take into account the damage to our soils, the way we’re exhaustingfossil fuels and our mineral reserves, and the depletion of our groundwater,” RicardoSalvador told me.Given the economic crisis that began in 2008, the fact that the government funnels taxdollars to so many farmers who already have comfortable incomes seems scandalous.Still, federal crop insurance continues to do everything to support conventionalagriculture and very little to support alternatives. Farmers pay a reduced rate for cropinsurance when they plant seeds that are Roundup-ready or have some other geneticmodification, because these crops are seen as being less risky than non-GMO crops. Onthe other hand, they pay a premium on their crop insurance if they farm organically. Andfarmers who plant cover crops—cover crops!—can actually be denied crop insurance insome situations. Farmers like Gabe Brown who plant companion crops—clover alongwith his oats, for instance—are booted from the program entirely. “I’m saving fossil fuelsand fertilizer and improving soil health, but I’m penalized for it,” Brown told me. “Thegovernment knows nothing about how nature works.”“You’d probably see a lot of changes in the system if we stopped crop insurance,”explained Cornelia Flora, an emeritus sociologist at Iowa State University. “It’s true thatfarming is a risky business, but the insurance lets you do anything you want. If you’reinsured against crop failure and you’re insured against price failure, why would you everdo anything different from the way you’ve always done it—because that’s when you won’tbe able to get crop insurance. In other situations, a risk reduction strategy might be cropdiversification or something more systemic than just saying the government will bail meout.”The land-grant universities that Lincoln so proudly signed into being have also beencompromised by a huge influx of corporate cash. These public institutions include someof our largest and most prestigious centers of learning, including the University ofCalifornia system, Pennsylvania State University, and Texas A&M University. Beginningin the 1970s (and aside from a brief resurgence in the 1980s), federal and state supportfor these institutions—covering both their research and operating expenses—began todwindle. Agribusiness has eagerly filled the gap.98One particular financial blow to the land-grant universities has had a direct impacton farmers and ranchers. The USDA has steadily reduced funding to the agriculturalextension services that used to pump research findings from the universities toagriculturalists via training and educational materials. Farmers used to bring theirproblems to these extension agents, who would offer insights from the latest research. Butwith the number of extension agents dwindling, farmers have few options but to turn to theagronomists and those stationed at the grain elevators, where they buy seed andchemicals.“Back in the 1980s, the extension agents trained people at the elevator to be theireyes on the ground,” said LaVon Griffieon, an Iowa farmer who raises antibiotic-andhormone-free beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and lamb. “But all they have is a magic potionfor your problem. It’s all solved chemically, and we don’t get that extension of knowledgefrom our land-grant universities that we used to get.”But a damning report issued by Food and Water Watch in 2012 indicates how shakythat knowledge itself has become. “By the early 1990s, industry funding surpassed USDAfunding of agricultural research at land-grant universities. In 2009, corporations, tradeassociations and foundations invested $822 million in agricultural research at land-grantschools, compared to only $645 million from the USDA (in inflation-adjusted 2010dollars). . . . Industry-sponsored research effectively converts land-grant universities intocorporate contractors, diverting their research capacity away from projects that serve thepublic good.”With less federal funding for research, land-grant university faculty under pressure toconduct research and publish the results—this is what determines tenure and salaries—have to go where the funding dollars are flowing, which is the private sector. Of course,they can’t necessarily get funding for the work that they’re really interested in; theirresearch has to reflect a corporate agenda to win corporate dollars. That corporate funderthen benefits from the tax dollars underpinning that scholar, student body, and university.Robert Taylor, an economist at Auburn University who studies agribusiness structure andconcentration, told me, “Let’s say I get a $100,000 corporate grant for field experiments. Istill have most of my salary paid from taxpayer funds, but I devote all my energies to the$100,000 project. This leverages taxpayer funds in a fuzzy way and, in effect, becomes acorporate subsidy.”Nearly half of all land-grant ag scientists surveyed in 2005 reported that they hadreceived research funds from the private sector. One of the problems with this is the socalledfunder effect: Studies show that industry-funded research is more likely to reachfavorable conclusions for that industry. And often, the results of these studies arepublished in journals that don’t require the study’s authors to disclose the sources of theirfunding. Still, this research often guides policy makers and regulators.When I talked to Tim Schwab, the lead researcher for the Food and Water Watch99report, he said that both the USDA’s research arm—the Agricultural Research Service—and the land-grant universities are failing to conduct the independent agricultural researchwe need. “When you look for research on the safety or environmental impacts ofgenetically engineered crops, there just isn’t much coming out of our universities,” hesaid. “The ARS should be stepping up to the plate and doing the really robust necessaryresearch, but they’re not.”Schwab pointed to a recent kerfuffle to make his point. French molecular biologistGilles-Eric Séralini published a 2012 study of Monsanto’s genetically engineered cornand the Roundup herbicide used with it and found major health concerns. Detractors andeven science journalists said that Séralini was ideologically driven and had been fundedby a foundation that was biased against genetic engineering (and one critic of industrialagriculture even told me that Séralini used the mouse strain and sample size to get theresults he wanted). Schwab told me that science journalists routinely fail to notice theconverse: that industry has funded most of the studies showing that genetically engineeredseeds are safe. “The kind of corn Séralini studied has been shown in the scientificliterature to be safe and effective,” Schwab said. “But all the studies I could find on itwere performed by or paid for by Monsanto.”As the Food and Water Watch report shows, corporate influence at the land-grantuniversities goes well beyond funding research. Donations from agribusiness announcetheir brands across campus: Witness the $1 million donation that resulted in the MonsantoStudent Services Wing at Iowa State University, the $200,000 donation to the Universityof Illinois that resulted in the Monsanto Multimedia Studio, and the named ConAgra andKroger research laboratories at Purdue. Some universities sell seats on academicresearch boards to corporations. For instance, a $20,000 donation gets industry sponsorsseats on the University of Georgia’s Center for Food Safety’s board of advisors, wherethey can influence research direction. Takers include Cargill, ConAgra, General Mills,Unilever, McDonald’s, and Coke. Industry also spends millions endowing faculty chairs.“This list could be so huge it would be comical,” the Union of Concerned Scientists’Ricardo Salvador told me. “The most notorious is the case of Novartis literally buyingthe entire College of Natural Resources at Berkeley.*”The fusion of corporate and university interests is also stunning at South Dakota StateUniversity (SDSU). University president David Chicoine joined Monsanto’s board ofdirectors in 2009 and received $390,000 the first year. At around the same time, theuniversity joined the Monsanto subsidiary WestBred in its effort to sue farmers for seedpatentinfringement—a stark contrast to the old days, when land-grant universitiesdeveloped public seeds which farmers could use, save, and share as they wished. “Whatmakes the university lawsuits against farmers more offensive is the fact that SDSU wheatseeds were developed with farmer and taxpayer dollars,” says the Food and Water Watchreport.100Unless researchers win grants from the dwindling pool of federal dollars doled outby the USDA, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy, they’reunlikely to be able to conduct research on alternative agriculture or investigate problemswith conventional agriculture. Even the USDA’s research agenda is biased towardconventional agriculture—that’s the system that’s in place, and most of their funding isbased on improving that system, not changing it. And even if researchers win federaldollars to conduct experiments in regenerative agriculture or investigate problems withBig Ag, they risk antagonizing university administrators, who keep an anxious eye on thecontinuing good graces of their corporate sponsors.“It’s not that you have companies like Monsanto controlling the land-grantuniversities, but they’re always in the shadows,” Fred Kirschenmann told me.“Administrators are always looking over their shoulders.”Kirschenmann points to the career of one of his young colleagues at Iowa StateUniversity as an example of the subtle chilling effect this corporate pressure can exert.Ecologist Matt Liebmann had an experiment going for 9 years in which he compared theconventional two-crop rotation of corn and soybeans with three- and four-crop rotations.With these more complex rotations and more diverse crops, Liebmann found that farmerscould reduce their fertilizer use by 90 percent and pesticide use by almost 90 percent,with comparable yields and more money going to the farmer. “The university has its ownpublic relations system and they select what they’re going to publicize, and they nevereven mentioned Matt’s work,” Kirschenmann said. “It wasn’t until Mark Bittman foundout about it [through the Union of Concerned Scientists] and did an article in the New YorkTimes that the public found out.”Liebmann conducted another study looking at the habits of two varieties of fieldmouse, the prairie deer mouse and the white-footed mouse. He found that if farmers don’ttill their fields in the fall to make planting quicker in the spring, those two breeds wouldeat up to 70 percent of the weed seeds in the field and dramatically reduce the need forherbicides. Again, the university PR system ignored Liebmann’s work.Kirschenmann’s own story is an example of the less-subtle chill—more like an icing—triggered when someone at a land-grant university seems as if they’re issuing too muchof a challenge to industrial agriculture. Kirschenmann is a North Dakota philosopher witha 2,600–acre organic farm and an international leader in sustainable agriculture who in2000 was hired as the director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at IowaState University. Shortly after his appointment, he called together a meeting of leaders insustainable agriculture from outside the university, invited them to read the statelegislation that created the center in 1987, and asked for suggestions in fulfilling itsmission. Karl Stauber, President Clinton’s undersecretary of agriculture for research,education, and economics, spoke up. “It’s clear that the Leopold Center is supposed to bea center for change,” Kirschenmann recalls him saying. “If you’re going to be a center for101change, then you have to recognize that the people who are in power don’t want change.The people who are going to be interested in change are the people who live on thefringes.”Kirschenmann embraced this. At the vibrant fringe, he found groups like the PracticalFarmers of Iowa, a group of individuals younger than the average farmer (58) who wereconducting on-site research to help themselves and others create a better agriculture. Henow thinks he may not have paid enough attention to the mainstream agricultural entities.“I’m not a skilled politician,” he admitted to me.One of the things Kirschenmann did that seemed to rankle was organize a meeting ofsmaller pork producers—not farmers with hundreds or thousands of pigs in CAFOs(concentrated animal feeding operations) that result in undifferentiated commodities, butfamily-size operators—along with university faculty and food-industry reps to talk aboutniche marketing of differentiated pork products. Thirty farmers were interested, andKirschenmann helped them form the Leopold Center–supported Pork Niche MarketWorking Group.Kirschenmann called the Iowa Pork Producers—the group representing commodityCAFO operators—and asked to speak to their board at their next meeting to discuss newopportunities for smaller producers. He spoke for 15 minutes. When he finished, thepresident of the board began to shout and pound his fists on the table. “You’re just likeeveryone else who’s trying to make us look bad!” Kirschenmann recalls him saying.Kirschenmann thinks that these big players in industrial agriculture became more andmore dissatisfied with his leadership of the Leopold Center and pressured the universityto make a change. In 2005, 5 years after he arrived, he was relieved of his position.Still, Kirschenmann is hopeful. Despite the early hostility that precipitated the loss ofhis job at the Leopold Center, Iowa Pork Producers and the Pork Niche Market WorkingGroup have worked together cooperatively for the past decade or more. And in additionto his enduring Iowa connection, he’s involved with the Stone Barns Center for Food andAgriculture in New York, and every year they harness some 15 to 20 apprentices to thework of growing food sustainably. The apprentices often move on to work on independentfarms and then launch their own businesses. Kirschenmann is watching the creation of anew wave of farmers, who are headed out to lap the land with a new kind of husbandrythat embraces the complexity of Mother Earth.Back in the early 1970s, my beloved father- and mother-in-law were selling theirfamily business. They lived in a small town in the Catskills and the buyers were from thebig city, and at one point, my father-in-law thought the buyers were trying to takeadvantage of them. “Do they think we’re farmers?” he sputtered to my then-husband andme.I’ve often turned that over in my head as I’ve walked through a farmers’ market. My102father-in-law used the word “farmers” to imply stupidity—and sure, Iowa farmer LaVonGriffieon did tell me that applying Roundup is so easy you could send a monkey out to doit. But many of the young farmers tending their stands at the market know the science ofturning sunlight into asparagus or strip steaks, and they enjoy holding forth about it to thecrowds of shoppers. They’re like rock stars. Vert, very smart ones.# Chapter 7: New BedfellowsIt was dusk when I arrived at Davis for the California Rangeland ConservationCoalition conference in February of 2012, and there were still enough slants ofsunlight to see orange balls dangling from trees along the city streets. Nice, I thought; alingering civic adornment for Christmas. Then I realized they were actual oranges. I hadsomehow forgotten what late winter is like in this part of California, just 60 miles fromwhere I grew up.The conference was billed as an event for ranchers, range scientists,environmentalists, and others interested in protecting rangeland—which occupies abouthalf of California—and keeping it healthy. Here, I felt positively naked without a cowboyhat, which was so much the chapeau du jour that I feared all sorts of people were goingto start addressing me as “little lady.” (I’ll generalize that there is a handsomegraciousness on the part of cattle people, whether they’re men or women.)The conference organizers took pains to mix the crowd and assigned seats for everymeal. Thus, on day two, I found myself sitting at a table with, among others, a scientistfrom the university and a couple of grad students, a few people from public agencies, awoman from Defenders of Wildlife on my left, and a rancher from Kansas who had justgiven a talk about his own conservation work on my right. For a while I just listened tothe conversations going on around the table, then I asked Jessica Musengezi fromDefenders of Wildlife and Bill Sproul, the rancher, if they would have ever imaginedthemselves sitting together at lunch 5 or 10 years ago.She smiled and shook her head.Sproul regarded me solemnly. “If we had been sitting at the same table 10 years ago,”he said, “we would have been on opposite ends. And we’d have been sitting therebecause one of us was suing the other.”I wasn’t that surprised. At the Quivira conference the previous fall, I’d not only beentold that academic agricultural science didn’t take much of an interest in the soil healthmovement, I’d also been told that many environmentalists weren’t attuned to thismovement with the kind of wild enthusiasm I’d expected.One of the speakers at Quivira was Sara Scherr, president and CEO ofEcoAgriculture Partners, an organization that advocates for land use that provides rurallivelihoods, ecosystem services, and productive agriculture. She spoke of the warinesssome climate activists express about the idea of soil carbon sequestration, and later104explained the divide over the course of some e-mails and a phone call.Since the early years of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992,the negotiators—who are principally meteorologists and energy specialists—were biasedagainst climate change mitigation strategies that focused on land use, Scherr said. Theirfocus was on reducing fossil-fuel emissions and transforming the energy sector, and theydidn’t want to dilute that focus—even though greenhouse gas emissions from land useaccounts for some 30 percent of total emissions—and they didn’t understand or trust thatagriculture could actually remove carbon from the air and sequester it in the soil.“Their perception was that land use was too variable and complex to deal with,relative to the ‘simplicity’ of energy, in the eyes of energy experts,” Scherr told me.Moreover, these environmentalists didn’t trust the idea of selling carbon creditsbased on soil sequestration. They didn’t believe that the carbon could be stored therepermanently and even if it could, they didn’t believe that doing so wouldn’t cause“leakage”—more carbon-dioxide producing activities elsewhere. “They thought it wouldbe a boondoggle and a way for high GHG-emitting industries to avoid action,” Scherrsays. “There remains reluctance among some groups to fully utilize emission reductionsand sequestration opportunities from the land-use sector.”This skepticism is likely reinforced by the fact that many agriculturalists—the peoplewho would be doing the sequestering of carbon through better practices—profess adisbelief in human agency being behind global warming and only embrace it becauseselling carbon credits could become another income stream. But even before globalwarming became such an all-consuming issue, there was a wary distance at best betweenenvironmentalists and agriculturalists.The conflict has its roots in America’s very earliest concept of conservation, saysCourtney White, an archaeologist who was a Sierra Club activist in the Southwest duringthe 1990s, when the conflict was at its most bitter. “There were rivers of bad bloodbetween ranchers and environmentalists,” White told me. “Booby traps were being set inthe wilderness for loggers and people gathering wood. There was a bomb lobbed in thewindow of the Nevada Bureau of Land Management office. I thought, ‘My God, what’sgoing on?’ I felt I had to do something.”The something that he did was to found the Quivira Coalition with a conservationmindedrancher who—to his surprise and joy—joined the Sierra Club. Quivira seeks the“radical middle” ground between agriculturalists and environmentalists and engages bothin projects of common interest and education. A “do” tank, White says, as opposed to athink tank.But he himself does a lot of thinking about the gulf between these two groups thathave such a hard time talking to each other even though both love the land. In an essay forthe Quivira Coalition journal, Resilience, he traces the evolutionary stages of the105country’s environmental movement, showing its historic divergence with people whoworked the land for a living and the new and hopeful trend toward respect andcollaboration.Beginning in 1783, White writes, the policy of the US government was to encourageprivate citizens to settle on public lands and make productive use of them—to live thegrand aspirations of what would later be called Manifest Destiny. That began to change in1891, when president Ulysses S. Grant set aside Wyoming’s Yellowstone as a nationalpark. Nineteen years later, Congress created the National Forest Reserve system toprotect valuable timberland from development and conserve it for future needs; presidentTheodore Roosevelt had doubled these reserves by 1907, only 4 years after he createdthe first National Wildlife Refuge at Pelican Island in eastern Florida. The National ParkService was founded in 1916 with about 35 parks and monuments; by the mid-1990s, itcontrolled more than 400 properties. After World War II, government extended itsmanagement of wild places when 175 million acres of public rangelands were put underthe control of the Bureau of Land Management.White describes all of this—including the creation of the Environmental ProtectionAgency in 1970 and environmental legislation in the 1970s—as the “federalist” wave ofconservation. The underlying conceit was that government needed to play an active rolein protecting the resources and even the wild beauty of America’s iconic lands.But that view of government as benevolent protector of public lands was becomingjaundiced in the 1960s and 1970s. Environmentalists bristled when they saw governmentagencies allow cattle grazing, logging, or mining on public lands. Ranchers and otherswho wanted working access to public lands bristled when government restricted andcontrolled their admittance, claiming that it was acting on behalf of urban-dwelling naturetourists and environmental kooks. The governmental agencies became less able to managepublic lands effectively, partly because of dwindling budgets, but also because ofgrowing dysfunction and resistance to change.But the friction between environmentalists and agriculturalists had less to do withtheir view of government than their relationship with the land itself. Both loved the land,but for different reasons. Environmentalists thought the highest use of public lands and,indeed, the rest of the wild landscape, was to leave them alone and undeveloped, with thepossible exception of recreational installations such as hiking trails and canoeconcessions. And obviously, agriculturalists wanted to work the land. Theindustrialization of agriculture that had begun during the mid-20th century was alsointensifying during this same period of time. Many small farms collapsed and sold theirland to their bigger neighbors, who were following the exhortations from government andacademia to get bigger still. Environmentalists could rightly point to a degradation of theenvironment as mega-farms took shape and their downriver impacts became obvious. Butto many farmers and ranchers trying to hold on to their land and stay in business, the106environmental ethos seemed like something they could ill afford.Courtney White is familiar with the myopic views of environmentalists, since he hadbeen an activist himself. In his essay, he argues that their disregard for the livelihoods ofrural people led to several problems. Their economic agenda of tourism and recreationhad unforeseen negative effects, including congestion, pollution, and exurban sprawl. Andthey lost what Aldo Leopold, one of environmentalism’s patron saints in the 1940s, calledthe feeling of “the soil between our toes,” which White interprets as an intimateunderstanding of how the land actually works. Leopold had always insisted that peopleand their economic activities are part of the environment. “There is only one soil, oneflora, one fauna, and one people, and hence only one conservation problem,” Whitequotes from Leopold’s 1935 lecture, “Land Pathology.” “Economic and esthetic land usescan and must be integrated, usually on the same acre.”But in the 1990s, environmentalists were fiercely trying to pry the one from the other,and White found himself squarely in the middle. The contention was fierce in NewMexico, where environmentalists agitated for a ban on any form of logging on publiclands, including traditional wood gathering for family use that Hispanic villagers hadbeen conducting for centuries. “They really dropped the hammer on rural people,” Whitetold me. “The Hispanic community went kind of berserk, rightfully, because they saw thisas racist. At one point, the villagers hung two prominent environmentalists in effigy.”The Sierra Club floated a referendum among its members calling for a ban of loggingon public lands in 1996, and it passed. A similar referendum banning ranching on publiclands narrowly lost. White was a longtime environmentalist, but his background inanthropology also informed the way he looked at the conflict. “I came out of schoolthinking a lot about how people and culture and history affect land,” he said. “Anyarchaeologist can tell you that past cultures have both benefitted and hurt theirenvironment. You can’t be ahistorical and be a good conservationist. Unfortunately, manyconservationists don’t look at it that way.”Indeed not. White opened the newspaper one day to find himself being accused by afellow environmentalist of being an archaeologist—as if that were a badge of shame.“He meant that I was interested in culture and history and people, whereas he was onlyinterested in the environment,” White said. “For me, that framed a lot of my discontentwith the movement.”These days, White thinks both the hard-core old-school environmentalists andagriculturalists—the ones who would never think of working with one another—areincreasingly irrelevant. “The rest of us have moved on,” he says. “We’re trying to getlocal food systems going and trying to get carbon in soils and thinking about renewableenergy and so on. This larger group—I call it ‘21st-century conservationists’—has a lotof things to think about.”107These conservationists comprise both rural and urban people, both agriculturalistsand people whose only connection to agriculture is what they choose to have for dinner,and people working for government organizations and environmental groups. They havemuch in common, but one thing they often don’t share is language. The verbiagesurrounding climate change is highly charged and heavily politicized. Republicans used totalk about climate change in responsible ways, but were butted into denial by a wellfundedcampaign waged by the fossil-fuel industry. Al Gore stepped into the politicalvacuum but, say prominent pro-environment Republicans, did so in such a partisan waythat it was easy for conservatives to scorn anything he championed. Given that mostfarmers and ranchers are deeply conservative, environmental activists maintain friendlyties with them by choosing their words carefully.Feathers can fly when they don’t, as Dave Nomsen, the vice president of governmentaffairs for Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever found out.Nomsen grew up in Iowa, which once had more than 3 million acres of prairiewetlands interspersed with various kinds of agricultural fields. Conventional corn andsoybean agriculture has taken over the terrain and only 30,000 acres of those wetlands areleft. One result is a loss of habitat for the game birds that Nomsen and other hunters prize.The disappearance of this once-congenial landscape made an environmentalist out of him,and he’s been working since the late 1980s to get conservation into each consecutivefederal farm bill.In 2009, Nomsen wrote an article for Pheasants Forever’s membership newslettertitled “Global Climate Change’s Inevitable Impact on Hunters and Wildlife.” He detailedthe changes taking place on the landscape that pierce a hunter’s heart. With an increase intemperature, pheasant predators have expanded their range. Invasive species like fescueare edging out the native warm- and cool-season grasses that attract ground-nesting birds.“If you’re a pheasant egg,” Nomsen wrote, “even a one- or two-degree temperature riseor a change in grasses at the nest site can have a big impact on hatching rates. Couplechanging microclimates at the nest site with more extreme weather patterns and a hen’sability to pull off a clutch becomes more complicated.”Nomsen tried to rally his hunter membership at the end of the article, pointing out thatthe habitat conservation they’d always pursued relieves the oversaturated atmosphere ofcarbon dioxide and sequesters it in soil and plants. “If global climate change means takingcarbon out of the air through grass and tree plantings and wetland restorations, thenPheasants Forever has been in the global climate change business for over 26 years,” hewrote.Not what they wanted to hear! More members responded to this one article than toanything Nomsen had ever published, and 98 percent were negative. “We’ve got a lot ofsportsmen and sportswomen who are very conservative in their values and thinking,” hetold me. “There is clearly the need for some additional education in this area.”108Still, when it comes to work on the ground—on farms, on ranches, in wildernessareas and parks—the prescription for climate change mitigation is pretty much identicalto the prescription for more productive working lands, clean water, better air quality,bountiful wildlife habitat, and so on. So many environmental organizations, fromDefenders of Wildlife to the Environmental Defense Fund to Greenpeace, are nowworking with agriculturalists to build healthy, carbon-rich soils. They just don’t talk aboutglobal warming, which has become like Voldemort in some circles—“He Who Must NotBe Named.”These collaborations work because these environmentalists don’t march into ruralareas and point to the people there and say, “Our waterways are getting polluted and youare the problem.” Well, in some cases they do say something like that, but without the oldhostility. For instance, Steve Richter from the Nature Conservancy (TNC) is working witha variety of partners to reduce the amount of phosphorus from fertilizers and sediment thatis polluting the Wisconsin waterways from farmlands. The state government haddiscussed legislation to require farmers to buffer their croplands from the streams, butdecided to try a carrot approach and forgo the stick.Richter works with scientists to pinpoint how much phosphorus is leaving the fieldsworked by every farmer in the watershed, then approaches them to discuss it. He arriveswith a handful of suggestions for ways to address the problem—using cover crops, goingno-till, changing their fertilizer use, and so on—and offers to help them access federalconservation dollars to effect the change over a 2- to 3-year period.“Some of them already wanted to try some of these practices, but this stuff has towork for them,” Richter told me. “They want to build that soil and have it stay on theirland. We’re showing with this project that you can have these discussions and makechange.”When I spoke to Richter, he was working with the 10 farmers whose fields drainedthe most phosphorus and sediment into the Pecatonica River. Nine had agreed to makechanges on their land, and he had a meeting scheduled with the tenth.A group of New England scientists formed the Nature Conservancy back in 1946—itsoriginal name was the Ecologists Union—to save biologically precious lands that wereheld privately. For nearly 40 years, the organization’s primary focus was to purchasethese lands, which they would either protect themselves or sell to the federal governmentfor protection. By 2007, the Nature Conservancy was protecting 119 million acres of landand thousands of miles of rivers worldwide. They help protect approximately 15 millionacres in the United States.But this approach ignored the economic drivers of landscape degradation and failedto embrace the concept of working land. Bitterness festered after TNC’s 1990 purchase ofthe historic Gray Ranch in New Mexico, considered one of the most significant109ecological landscapes in America. The local population was angered by TNC’s plan tosell this working ranch to the federal government. They protested the sale, and TNClistened. Instead of selling to the government, they sold the ranch to a local foundationestablished to maintain the property as a working ranch with a conservation agenda.By now, the Nature Conservancy and many other environmental organizations operatein the same “radical center” as White’s Quivira Coalition. Just as Steve Richter does inWisconsin, environmentalists around the world are sitting down with farmers andranchers to discuss their land management conundrums and look for solutions thatdovetail with their environmental mission. Magnificent convergences are emergingpiecemeal around the globe; hopefulness about our future seems reasonable in the light ofthese win-win ventures. This “new agrarianism,” as Courtney White calls it, considersthe vital thread running through both our physical and social landscapes. In this newvision, we can work with nature to heal the damage we’ve created. Farmers and rancherscan make a good and honorable living. And we can all eat food that’s good for us, insteadof the nutritionally vapid and often dangerous stuff that passes for food in oursupermarkets.In California, TNC has been buying orchards along the Sacramento and CosumnesRivers in the Central Valley. The rivers flood these orchards frequently, and watererosion shreds them. It’s a win for the farmers eager to get capital out of these delicateareas and invest it elsewhere. It’s a win for the environment overall, as TNC has restoredsome 5,000 acres of riparian forest along the Sacramento River, buffering it from theorchardists’ chemicals and allowing it to meander. The erosion that occurs naturally alongthe river’s edge provides good habitat for the bank swallow, which burrows and nestsinto the freshly eroded banks every spring.The organization also kept some of the orchards in operation, leasing them to localfarmers and inviting them to experiment with using alternative and less chemically harshways of controlling pests. One of the harsh chemicals that TNC wanted to help farmersmove away from was diazinon, a pesticide that attacks the nervous system—affected fishcan’t navigate properly. On the TNC orchards, plum growers figured out how to usepheromone mating disruption—insect sex hormones embedded in long, thin plastic tubes—to thwart pests. When they’re attached to the branches of the trees, they flood theorchards with mating signals, which confuse the pests and make it hard for the males andfemales to zero in on each other. They fail to reproduce, and fewer pests swarm theorchard. TNC and the farmers conducted monitoring and held field days and eventuallyreceived the governor’s award for integrated pest management. There’s the other win:Those of us who eat these fruits and fish have one less hideous chemical to worry about.TNC has also done a lot of work with nitrogen-fixing cover crops in California.Their test plots convinced many orchardists that this practice would not only providenitrogen to their trees, but would also improve their soil and its ability to hold water,110helping them cut back on irrigation costs. For a state that suffers chronic water shortagesand that relies on mountain snowpack for 30 percent of its water—and that mountainsnowpack faces an uncertain future in a warmer climate—anything that helpsagriculturalists avoid runoff and hold water in the soil is a tremendous boon. “Covercrops really took off in the vineyards,” said Dawit Zeleke, a TNC regional director and amandarin orange grower himself. “In fact, a lot of vineyards were organic, but they didn’twant to admit it because the organic sector of the wine business was so weak.”TNC and other environmental groups have also been working on problems related torice agriculture, which occupies more than 500,000 acres in California and more than 2.5million acres in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Texas. Farmers used todispose of rice field stubble by burning it—I remember looking over the SacramentoValley from our house in Oroville, where the foothills of the Sierra Nevada began, andseeing a gray drapery of smoke hanging over the valley. I remember its faintly sweet odor.For people closer to the burn, though, the soot-laden air caused respiratory problems, andburning stubble was banned in 2000. Farmers now flood their fields after harvest todecompose the stubble in water.When that new shimmer of water appeared in TNC’s orchards, it turned out to be abeacon for migrating birds along the Pacific Flyway. Vast numbers of birds summer inCanada, Alaska, and the northern United States, and their ancestral routes to Central andSouth America have always wafted them into California’s Central Valley, where manystay for the winter. But 95 percent of the valley’s natural wetlands disappeared over thelast century, leaving the birds precious little habitat as they seek their winter homes. Theflooding of the rice fields presented them with a new freshwater option. As a result, theirpopulation has rebounded to healthy numbers, says Zeleke—including species like thewhite-faced ibis, which were nearly extinct.And the birds are an unexpected boon for the rice farmers, too. The bacteria that theyintroduce to the fields through their droppings create a more diverse microbial populationand more fertile, nitrogen-rich soil. The Nature Conservancy is now working with ricefarmers to more purposefully manage their fields with the birds in mind: Together, they’reexperimenting with different water depths for different bird species, with draining theirfields in stages so there’s always some water for the birds, and with creating mudflats.However, leaving the stubble on the ground to rot underwater created a new problem.This anaerobic decomposition creates methane, a greenhouse gas 34 times more powerfulthan carbon dioxide. This bothers the rice growers for a number of reasons, not the leastof which being that it makes them a target for new and stringent state or federalregulations.This is the kind of dilemma that attracts the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). Theorganization has three different teams working on agricultural issues, and one headed byRobert Parkhurst studies science and fieldwork to figure out market solutions to climate111change. Their overall goal is to cut 100 million metric tons of greenhouse gases fromagriculture and forestry by 2020. That’s about 40 percent of the annual greenhouse gasemissions from American automobiles.Parkhurst’s team began approaching rice farmers in 2007 to work toward a solutionthat benefits both agriculture and the environment. Working with a soil scientist, aresearch hydrologist, and a systems agronomist, EDF came up with a list of six practicesthat can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Four of these practices reduce the amount oftime the stubble as well as the seeds and growing rice are in contact with water during thewarm growing season, when emissions are highest and the waterfowl haveserendipitously departed. Some of these practices reduce the amount of water needed togrow the crop, which can create considerable savings for farmers in parts of the countrywhere they run diesel engines to pump groundwater—one of their biggest costs. EDFwrapped these win-win practices into a protocol that was scheduled to become part ofCalifornia’s cap-and-trade program in the spring of 2014. “Producers can now farm riceand greenhouse gas offsets at the same time,” Parkhurst told me.Parkhurst’s team is developing another protocol for an agricultural practice that notonly reduces emissions, but also sucks carbon dioxide from the air and stores it in the soilas carbon. This practice employs one of the most ancient low-tech agriculturaltechnologies on the planet, one that Rome’s Pliny the Elder lauded in his writings:compost.Elaine Ingham tells me that compost has a bad reputation these days. This shocks me,because I grew up in a household where compost was revered and nothing—nothing!—went into a garbage can that would have been useful for the compost pile. Or rather,compost piles—my parents had three bins in various stages of decomposition locatedunder a deck off their living room. I liked dropping the cantaloupe rinds and carrot topsor whatever from that height. The rinds often hit the wooden sides of the bins andshattered. Carrot tops fluttered into lacy arrangements on top of the piles. Eggshellssometimes blew off course.My parents had no idea why compost was so good for their garden; like most people,they probably assumed that that this broken down (mostly) plant material acted as anatural fertilizer. But that’s not quite how it works. When you put a layer of compost overyour soil, you’re basically transporting a metropolis of tiny creatures to your yard. Anyplants there will be serviced like one of the Tudor kings, with billions of microorganismseager to exchange their gifts of phosphorus, nitrogen, and other nutrients for a sip ofcarbon.But there is good compost and bad, so-called compost, Ingham says. The latter isoften the stuff that waste control companies make from the land clippings and yard waste—and, here in Portland, kitchen scraps—that’s picked up and carried away by loud trucksearly in the morning. They make the bad so-called compost not to create a valuable soil112amendment, but to shrink the amount of waste going into landfills. “They want to reduce aten-foot pile into a two-foot pile,” Ingham told me. “And sometimes they try to sell it topeople as compost. They should stop calling it that. It’s putrefied organic matter and itwill kill your plants.”Good compost requires the aerobic decomposition of organic matter. Very basically,you assemble a pile of materials—some woody or dry plant materials (wood chips ordried leaves or even shredded newspaper) and some green plant materials (grassclippings) and a small amount of nitrogen-rich manure or legumes or nuts—and build it toa height of about 3 feet. Microorganisms live on the plant material and manure as well asin the soil, and they begin to eat the simple carbons in these piles and poop out slightlymore complex carbon chains and reproduce. The heat of their reproduction causes thepile to warm—and yes, when you stick your hand in a compost pile or even a heap ofgrass clippings and feel the heat, that’s the hubba-hubba of microbial sex.A good compost pile heats up so much that it kills pathogens and weed seeds. ButIngham says that if the interior of the pile reaches 160 degrees, it needs to be turned. Allthat microbial activity requires oxygen, but if the heat rises past 160 it means that themicrobes are reproducing so quickly that they will use oxygen faster than it can penetratethe pile. If that happens, the aerobic microbes go to sleep and the anaerobic microbes takeover. Then, instead of a sweet-smelling compost hued, Ingham says, like a chocolate barwith a 70 percent cocoa content, you’ll have a foul-smelling black pile of so-calledcompost filled with ammonia and other nasty anaerobic by-products.Good compost can work wonders. Berkeley soil scientist Whendee Silver and herstudents have been conducting research on the power of compost at a 539-acre cattleranch on the California coast near Nicasio. As part of a collaboration called the MarinCarbon Project, they spread a centimeter of compost on the soil and monitored the site for3 years to observe changes above and below the soil. The changes above the soil wereapparent to even the nonscientist: The grasses exploded in a green flurry of growth, for a50 percent increase in forage. Underground, Silver discovered, the amount of carbon inthe soil was also increasing dramatically. Overall, the carbon sequestered in the plantsand ground increased by 25 to 70 percent at six sites, not including the carbon in thecompost itself.Based on her research, Silver estimates that just half of California’s 63 million acresof rangeland could absorb 42 million tons of CO2—nearly 40 percent of whatCalifornia’s power plants emit in a year—if each acre sequestered an additional 1.5 tonsof carbon in its soil. “Given what we’ve seen in our experiments,” Silver told me, “oneand a half tons is doable.”Silver and her students made their compost from city yard waste mixed withagricultural waste, including manure. While it sounds impractical to truck hedgetrimmings and spent dandelions all the way out to a ranch so they can join cow pies in a113compost pile, the Environmental Defense Fund, which is a partner in the Marin CarbonProject, believes an approach like this would work well in certain areas. Largemunicipalities generate a lot of food and green waste, and many are surrounded byrangeland. When dumped in landfills, these organic wastes emit methane. But if thisorganic waste is diverted from the landfill, then composted, then applied to nearbyrangelands, the overall impact on greenhouse gases could be significant. And not just inCalifornia, where Parkhurst and his team have turned this work into another protocol, firstfor Belinda Morris’s American Carbon Registry for the voluntary market and thereafterfor the California Cap-and-Trade Program. Fifty percent of California’s land israngeland, but a third of the United States is also rangeland. What if compost could workin other areas, too—New Mexico or Colorado or Arizona or Montana? If that were thecase, spreading compost on rangelands could be very big.“It’s not a silver bullet,” Parkhurst told me. “It’s not going to work everywhere foreveryone, but it will be a solution to the problem. The sources of climate change aremany, and so the solutions have to be just as many.”What makes all this work possible, Parkhurst hastened to add, is the new wave ofeffort by scientists who are finally paying attention to the life in the soil. “The interactionbetween microbes and plants and water and carbon is something we’re just now reallybeginning to understand better,” he said. “That’s what allows us to calculate the amount ofemissions averted or absorbed.”Where the Environmental Defense Fund sees an opportunity to create models andcarbon-offset protocols, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) sees an opportunity to influencesupply chains. WWF has a team that focuses on key commodities from around the worldthat affect conservation. One of these commodities is beef. The organization’s main focusin the United States is in the northern Great Plains, one of the few intact grasslands in theworld. The Great Plains blanket the land with grass from the Missouri River to the RockyMountains, bounded by Saskatchewan on the north and the Nebraska Sand Hills on thesouth.“These grasslands are intact because of the ranching community,” said the WWF’sJeff Nelson. “We want to see these ranchers have sustainable enterprises. If they struggleand leave the land, what replaces them might not be nearly as good for conservation.”Condominiums and cornfields—both are fetching high prices these days, temptingranchers to either sell or plow up the carbon that’s been accumulating in their soils forcenturies. So the WWF is trying to focus on ways of compensating ranchers for the carbonthey’re already protecting in the soil, as well as the wildlife they can shelter throughimproved practices. WWF is optimistic they can do this, because they have the mostpowerful ally in America on their side.That would be us, the consumers.114In the early 2000s, a groundswell of voices began to extol the virtues of cattle raisedon grass—the food they evolved to eat—as opposed to corn, the food they’re obliged toeat in modern feedlots and in many dairies. Corporate agriculture switched cows fromgreens to grain because they bulk up faster: One study has shown that cattle eating grassesand other forage gain only three quarters the weight of cattle raised on grains. But thatweight gain, which translates into heftier profits for the likes of ConAgra and NationalFarms, comes at a cost to the animals’ health. Corn stresses the bovine digestive systemand can lead to bloat and other disorders, all the way up to liver failure.This steady diet of corn along with the cramped quarters in feedlots and confineddairies tends to keep cattle in chronic poor health, so the operators routinely mixantibiotics into their feed. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can develop as a result and thencan be passed on to humans through beef consumption and leave us vulnerable whenwe’re sick and need the intervention of antibiotics.Journalist Jo Robinson, author of Eating on the Wild Side and Pasture Perfect, wasone of the earliest advocates for putting cows out to pasture. Her Web site Eatwild.comcollects the studies underlining the differences between the meat from grass-fed and cornfedcattle. Among these studies: Researchers from the Translational Genomics ResearchInstitute (TGen) tested meat from US grocery stores and found that nearly half wereinfected with Staphylococcus aureus (“staph”) bacteria, which are closely linked toseveral human illnesses. The staph found in the meat was resistant to three classes ofantibiotics. “Densely-stocked industrial farms, where food animals are steadily fed lowdoses of antibiotics . . . are ideal breeding grounds for drug-resistant bacteria that movefrom animals to humans,” TGen’s Web site says.On the other hand, meat and milk from cattle raised on pasture seem to confer anumber of health benefits. Robinson’s survey of the scientific literature points to fourmajor pluses.First, pasture-raised meat has less fat and calories overall, since the animals are ableto move around. Potentially more important, the quality of the fat from grazed cattle isquite different in that it has two to four times as many omega-3 fatty acids as grain-fedbeef. These fats, which come from the grass itself (just as the omega-3s in wild salmoncome from the green algae eaten by their prey lower on the food chain), “play a vital rolein every cell and system in your body,” Robinson writes, and summon an armada of healthbenefits: lower risks of various cardiac problems and cancer, as well as lower rates ofdepression, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, and Alzheimer’ disease.The meat from pasture-raised cattle is also higher in vitamin E, which may haveantiaging properties and lower risks of heart disease and cancer. Meat and dairy productsare also the best known source of another good fat called conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).“CLA may be one of our most potent defenses against cancer,” Robinson writes. “In aFinnish study, women who had the highest levels of CLA in their diet had a 60 percent115lower risk of breast cancer that those with the lowest levels. Switching from grain-fed tograss-fed meat and dairy products places women in this lowest risk category.”When picky consumers and healthy-eating gurus started the clamor for grass-fedmeat, many cattle producers were aghast that anyone expected them to return to thepractices of their fathers and grandfathers. “Jo Robinson was a speaker at one of ourearly conferences, and her talk was quite controversial,” Quivira’s Courtney White toldme. “One rancher said, ‘You can’t say that about feedlots!’ Fast-forward, and 5 years laterhe was producing grass-fed beef himself. A lot of conservative, hard-nosed ranchers whosaid they’d never do it are now doing it.”So the mostly urban–based food movement is already helping to green thecountryside, as the higher prices fetched by grass-fed meat and dairy convinceagriculturalists to put their animals back out on pasture. The World Wildlife Fund hopesto attach even greater rewards to this trend. When I talked to Jeff Nelson, the organizationhad convened a first meeting in Montana with some of the state’s largest ranchers,retailers like McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, which are feeling the heat from consumers, andhuge commodity groups like the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. In effect, thismeeting and others that followed collapsed the retail chain from the pasture through thepackers and processors all the way to the checkout register. The goal is to create acertification program for beef that meets certain standards all along the way.Financial rewards are often the hook that draws agriculturalists closer to theenvironmental camp, but changed hearts tend to sprout unexpected wings.The conference I attended in Davis was convened by the California RangelandConservation Coalition, a group formed in 2005 by unlikely allies. On the one side, theDefenders of Wildlife (DOW) were trying to protect vernal pools, an ephemeral wetlandhabitat found largely in grasslands that typically forms from spring runoff and snowmeltand dries up in the summer. While they’re wet, vernal pools are an important ecosystemfor amphibians and insects that can’t survive in fishy waters, but they were beingbulldozed for housing developments all over California. DOW wanted the state’s fish andwildlife service to protect these fragile areas, and someone at the agency suggested theyseek allies in the ranching community. Ranchers were also worried about developersturning grasslands into cul-de-sacs, as it made land prohibitively expensive andthreatened their entire way of life.Don’t cattle damage fragile habitats? That was certainly the common assumptionamong environmentalists, but research published by Nature Conservancy scientist JaymeeMarty in 2005 proved it wrong. Over the course of 3 years, Marty observed that grazingactually helped vernal pools thrive by releasing the chokehold of exotic invasive plants.When she compared grasslands with no grazing to ones with continual grazing, she foundthat the ungrazed vernal pools had 88 percent greater cover from annual invasive plantsand 47 percent lower cover from native species. Ungrazed, the species richness of native116plants declined by 25 percent and the diversity of aquatic insects was 28 percent lower.Overall, the period of time these fleeting wetlands stayed wet dropped by 50 to 80percent without grazing, making it difficult for some species that lived there to completetheir life cycles. “We wouldn’t have gone ahead [with this partnership] without thescience showing that managed grazing would actually benefit the vegetation communitiesand wildlife we wanted to protect,” said Kim Delfino, DOW’s program director inCalifornia.So these two groups began a careful tiptoe toward each other. The first formalgathering was a barbecue at a Sunol, California, ranch that included ranchers, DOW, theEnvironmental Defense Fund, the Endangered Species Coalition, the CaliforniaCattlemen’s Association, the US Forest Service, and others. “For the first 30 minutes, itlooked like an eighth-grade dance with boys on one side and girls on the other, staring ateach other,” rancher Tim Koopmann told the University of California at Davis magazine.“Except in our case, the environmentalists stood against one wall and the cattlemenagainst another. But then we started talking and knew we could make it work.”Now, they refer to themselves as the Boots and Birken-stocks Bunch. They have aconference every year that looks at the environmental benefits of grazing as well as thegrazing practices that most enhance the environment. Together they work on deliveringconservation dollars to good ranchers and getting state and federal regulations in placethat support both conservation and the cattle industry. The partnership is so strong thatranchers and environmentalists can now broach even issues that would have had them atloggerheads before. “Wolves are coming from Oregon into California,” Delfino told me.“We’ve been able to talk to the ranching community about how to deal with that so muchmore easily than our colleagues in Wyoming or Montana or Idaho.”When Kansas rancher Bill Sproul told me that he and DOW’s Jessica Musengeziwould have sat at the same table 10 years ago only if one was suing the other, he wasn’tspeaking from personal experience. Sproul is a first-generation rancher who perhapsdidn’t have any ancestral suspicion of environmentalists, and he was never opposed to theidea of conservation. He just wanted to make sure he was paid for it.“I used to think on the commodity level,” Sproul told me. “I owned things and I usedthings and I made money. If you wanted me to do conservation, fine, but how much couldyou pay me to do it? What can I make out of it?”But the late 1990s took him to a triangular chunk of land spanning southeast Arizonaand southwest New Mexico, where a trial by fire had turned longtime headbutters intopartners. Earlier that decade, the Forest Service had rushed to put out a 500-acre wildfireon private land over the objection of the landowner. The Forest Service had a policy ofextinguishing all fires, but ranchers and some scientists felt that fire was a natural featureof their ecosystem and that suppressing it had allowed brush to take over too much oftheir grasslands. Leaders in the ranching community had already been meeting to discuss117other challenges, including the controversy over ranching on public lands that CourtneyWhite found so distressing. This confrontation with the Forest Service made them realizethat a policy of digging in their heels alone was useless. This was the genesis of theMalpai (named for the volcanic rock in the area) Borderlands Group, a pioneeringcoalition of ranchers, scientists, conservationists, government agencies, and concernedcitizens. Rancher Bill McDonald, a member of the group, coined the term “radical center”which now informs and inspires similar groups all over the country.Since then, Sproul has moved toward what he calls community conservation.“Everything is part of the community,” he said. “I’m part of it, you’re part of it, the cattleare part of it. The air, the land, the ants, the lizards. And the whole idea is to practiceconservation on a landscape scale. Wildlife and clean air don’t know where ranchboundaries are. They don’t know where Kansas ends and Nebraska starts.”Sproul feels that this perspective ultimately benefits him, because his cattle arehealthier when the landscape thrives. But sometimes he takes a financial hit to benefit thiscommunity. Like many ranchers in his area, he burns his grasslands every year to get anew flush of grass for his yearling steers, which he only keeps for 90 days before they’resent to a feedlot. By doing this, his cattle gain between a quarter and a third more poundsper day, and that adds up to a considerably larger sum in his bank account at the end of the90 days.On the other hand, burning all the grass means that birds that nest in the previousyear’s old grass lose habitat. The number of grassland birds is declining, and he suspectsthere’s some correlation. So he’s changed his annual burn to leave a mosaic of dead grassfor the birds.“I take a bit of a hit in the checkbook, but I’m okay with it,” Sproul told me. “Healthyisn’t just what’s in my checkbook. Healthy is also that scissor-tailed flycatcher sitting outthere on that fence, looking at me.”# Chapter 8: Heroes of the Underground

I noticed it over and over again as I worked on this book, whether I was talking tofarmers or ranchers or scientists—a quality so often missing in the ongoing dialogueabout our world that I at first mistook it for happiness, the sheer pleasure one takes inwork that one loves.But it was more than that. It was optimism.I offered up this observation about the soil-health visionaries I’d met to PeterDonovan, the piano tuner/musician, soil autodidact, and conductor of the Soil CarbonChallenge.“They’re connected with the most powerful geologic force, which is life,” he said.“Most of what we take to be the physical environment is, in fact, the creation of livingorganisms over time. That’s a different paradigm than the idea that life is a fragilepassenger on a dead planet.”When he said this, we were sitting in his bus parked on a dirt road that bisected thefarm, herbs growing on his hood, pasture burgeoning in the fields, the busyness of thesheep and sheepdog a distant noise, the cheerful agrarian commerce of the Corvallisfarmers’ market yet to come and much anticipated. I liked this idea of the robustness andongoing creativity of life, and it was easy to feel surrounded by it there.But what about back in the city?We often have the idea that cities are dead zones—concrete jungles—where the onlylife is that of us humans, moving through our various intersecting orbits, along with therats, pigeons, and cockroaches that flourish in our presence. But cities are also teemingwith life. Microbial ecologist Peter Groffman of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studiesin Millbrook, New York, says that only 20 percent of the urban landscape is trulyimpervious. The other 80 percent is natural or seminatural. “There are really a lot ofplants in urban areas, a lot of animals, and a lot of ecological function,” explainedGroffman, who since 1998 has been studying soil and water in Baltimore, one of 26 longtermecological research sites funded by the National Science Foundation. “There is a lotof soil functioning in urban areas”—the buildup of carbon, impeding nitrogen andphosphorus from washing away—“and, to me, that’s a really positive message.”I didn’t really need Groffman to tell me this, since I’ve never thought of cities asdead zones. For the last 20 or so years, I’ve walked my dogs along the same morning119route, first in Cleveland and now in Portland. There are at least two good things about afixed itinerary. Since I never have to think about where I’m going, my mind is free towander. And it wanders and wonders, quite frequently, over the daily changes in theyards, parks, tree lawns, and gutters around me.Only recently, I’ve seen how orange poppies burst forth in the spring, fade, and aredisplaced by pink-eyed phlox. Trees bloom and fruit, and sometimes all that progeny istoo much for the tree to bear: A branch breaks, the fruit spills, and people squash it intoboozy brown pulps on the sidewalk. After what seems like just a month, weedy upstarts inpavement cracks grow into sunflowers the size of saplings. A vacant lot is a swirl ofpurple sweet peas, blue chicory, and wild fennel that makes my dogs smell wonderful.Then it’s mowed and features cans and discarded plastic forks instead of flowers.I was curious to see how all that I had learned about the amazing life in the soil faredin these urban settings. In Cleveland, my dogs and I used to walk past huge housessurrounded by immense landscaped yards. Gardening season always brought funky air, astrucks arrived to spray lawn chemicals. When the rains came, muddy water often ran offand left a slick chocolate scrim on the sidewalks. I’d survey the offending property forevidence of exposed soil, such as unmulched beds, trees surrounded by wide bare circles,and land rototilled and scraped clean for vegetable plots. I imagined the deprived soilbiology in these naked spots shrieking, “Feed me!” like the voracious plant in Little Shopof Horrors. For the living things in the soil, these barren patches are food deserts.Portland has built swales along many streets to catch runoff. Still, I see lots of thesame blights on the soil in people’s gardens. Plus, there is an unholy fondness for gravelin Portland: whole tree lawns, even whole front yards covered with stony matter. Perhapsbecause plants are too much bother? Or because people think that gravel provides bettererosion control than roots?Groffman and other scientists are taking a serious look at ecological function incities. He’s excited about the trend of urban agriculture—farms are springing up in thewake of foreclosures in places like Cleveland—but also about all the possibilitiesoffered by that previously unrecognized 80 percent. “People manage these areas,” hesaid. “We live and work there. If we learn how they function, then we can improve oralter that capacity to reach certain goals, whether it’s carbon storage to regulate theclimate or absorbing water. It’s a great opportunity to use our understanding to achievespecific goals.”The challenge seems to lie in what we require of that 80 percent: We want the urbanflower beds to pack a lot of pretty into well-defined slivers, and we want the turf to bedurable enough for dogs, children, and adults wielding everything from strollers to soccerballs. Historically, we’ve been persuaded that synthetic chemicals and lots of gasguzzlingtools are needed to attain these goals.120But just as the agricultural world boasts pioneers and outliers, so does the urbanworld. One such is Eric T. Fleisher, director of horticulture at New York’s Battery ParkCity Parks Conservancy. Fleisher manages the park’s 36 acres organically, without eithersynthetic fertilizers or pesticides. His job is a demanding one, and not just because hisefforts have to please the public. His work also has to withstand the public. By the park’slast official count, up to 15 million people visit in a year, but Fleisher says they figure thenumber of visitors might now be as high as 25 million. That’s a lot of impact by sneakerand sandal, especially in the playgrounds. Even the vibrations of the subway increase soilcompaction. But Fleisher and his staff make the place lush and gorgeous without syntheticchemicals.They do this by respecting the ancient synergy between plants and soil organisms.They test the park’s soil every year and much more often in problem spots, examining thecomposition of the soil’s biology. If any crucial players are missing, Fleisher reintroducesthem with different recipes for compost and compost tea made from waste materialsgenerated within the park. He’s emphatic that he’s not making the compost to reduce thatwaste and the cost of hiring someone to haul it away. “It’s one thing to compost thismaterial just to get rid of it,” he told me. “It’s another to be producing something thatfeeds the nutrient cycling in the soil.”Even if soil is rich with nutrient-toting bacteria and fungi, plants can’t access thenutrients unless predator protozoa and nematodes feed on the bacteria and fungi andexcrete their nutrient treasures in plant-palatable forms. Fleisher and his crew have foundthat they can cure their compost in ways that produce greater populations of thesepredators—warmer and dryer piles produce hordes of nematodes and cooler and wetterpiles cause the protozoa population to boom. Before application, they put their compostsand teas under a microscope to determine who’s there. With this kind of precision, theycan fix chemical deficiencies in the soil.Fleisher’s organic management of the park has led to healthier plants and healthiersoil with greater water-holding capacity. That means not only that there’s less need forirrigation, but also that torrential downpours don’t turn the playgrounds into ponds.They’ve created the kind of healthy soil that soaks up the water quickly and holds it for along time.Change is frustratingly slow—really, why isn’t every manager of large urban parksand gardens doing this?—but Fleisher’s influence is spreading. In 2008, he spent a yearas a Loeb Fellow at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design and, while there, helpedHarvard’s landscaping staff apply organic principles to a test plot in Harvard Yard. Thetest was so successful that Harvard now manages 85 acres organically, creating compostand teas out of waste material from the site as well as cafeteria and dining hall leftovers.In a 2009 article for the New York Times, Anne Raver reported that the soil in HarvardYard—where some 8,000 people pass daily—was previously so compacted that the trees121were dying. Now, the soil is so healthy and well structured that the trees’ roots find plentyof room to expand for water, oxygen, and nutrients. The landscaping staff also saved a 40-year-old orchard there from leaf spot and apple scab by applying local compost tea.Fleisher helped Boston’s Rose F. Kennedy Greenway launch organically and is nowhelping Princeton University transition to organic, and it’s possible that managers of citylandscapes across the country may have new motivation to seek the organic approach.Peter Groffman told me that many Eastern cities are developing tree canopy goals (NewYork City’s is to plant 1 million more trees), since they cool cities in the summer, warmthem in the winter, and filter pollutants from the air. And they’re beautiful!“There are all these ecosystem services that come from trees, and cities want to plantmore of them,” he said. “To do that, they fundamentally need to understand what’s goingon in urban soils and how to amend them to get trees to grow. They don’t want tooverfertilize soil, or they’ll end up with more water and air pollution.”On my morning walk today, I passed a young tree planted on a sun–bleached treelawn (it hadn’t rained in weeks, and many Portlanders just let their lawns go brown in thesummer). An oval of dirt had been incised into the grass around its thin trunk, and thehomeowners had taken some care to remove every blade of grass within. The soil therewas as hard and flat as a cutting-board, and my first thought was that the tree didn’t standmuch of a chance. But Groffman’s research in Baltimore has led him to some startlingconclusions. “We assumed lawns were going to be biological deserts,” he told me.“They’re not. We’re taking core samples down to a meter and we’re finding a lot ofnatural-looking soil profiles in these lawns, not just compacted fill. A lot of roots, a lot ofbiology, a lot of carbon, and a better environmental performance than we expected.”We might be able to sniff lawn chemicals from a block away, but that doesn’tnecessarily mean lots of people are using them. Groffman found that homeowners aren’tmanaging their turf as aggressively as assumed. His surveys show that only about half ofhomeowners apply fertilizer to their lawns, and most don’t fertilize at a high rate.“Some people have a real environmental ethic and don’t want to be adding pesticidesand fertilizers and weed killers to the environment,” he told me. “There’s also, for lack ofa better term, just laziness. People do the minimum to keep their lawns looking niceenough so their appearance doesn’t bother their neighbors.”With fewer chemicals to turbocharge the performance of some plants and kill others,lawns become more diverse environments, both above and below the soil line. And justas in nature and on well-managed farms and ranches, this diversity supports the ancientand noble partnership of plants working with the biology in the soil. That partnershipsnatches carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, breaks it down into carbon, and puts thelatter to good use down under.About 80 percent of American homeowners have lawns. How each of us manages our122own individual turf may seem insignificant to the greater picture, given all the factors thatinfluence our world, but our turfs and turfettes add up. Lawns are the largest irrigatedcrop in America, taking up three times as much space as corn, the next-biggest irrigatedcrop. What we do with our urban green matters, whether it’s in our yards or our parks oreven our highway median strips.Are the lawns managed by the 50 percent of home owners who use no syntheticchemicals less pleasing to the eye? It depends upon the eye. When Bob Streitmatter tookover management of Luthy Botanical Garden in Peoria, Illinois, he quietly took the placeorganic. Clover began appearing in the turf grass, and Luthy’s visitors were perspicaciousand picky enough to comment on it. But he quickly won them over, explaining that cloveris a legume that makes nitrogen available to the turf and allows the staff to do away withfertilizer. Allowing clover to grow among the grass not only saves the public fromsynthetic chemicals, but also saves money that could be spent on other programs.“When you start making the change, it can be a little more costly,” Streitmatter toldme. “But you’re setting up a soil ecosystem for the long haul. Down the road, your costsdrop dramatically.”Luthy’s transition was so successful that Streitmatter now runs a class teachinghomeowners how to transition their own yards to soil health. He points out that a lot ofthese seemingly new ideas—like lawn care without chemicals and even rain barrels—were fixtures in the past. Clover actually used to be planted in partnership with turfgrasses before monoculture lawns became vogue, and the sight of it reassuredhomeowners that their lawns were healthy. Then Americans were swayed by themarketing of the landscaping chemical companies and started thinking that their lawnsshould look like the course at the Augusta National Golf Club.“I tell people that they aren’t going to be hosting the Masters,” Streitmatter said.“There’s no need to put that much water, chemicals, and labor into their lawn. It’s just notnecessary.”Streitmatter also guides homeowners to make other choices in their yards to createsoil health, and these echo the steps progressive farmers and ranchers are taking to buildsoil health on their land. He recommends flower beds designed for maximum biodiversityand density, featuring shrubs, perennials, and bulbs for both spring and fall bloom, withsome annuals and biennials wandering through. He suggests tucking some leguminousplants in there to add nitrogen. All these different landscaping plants will feed slightlydifferent recipes of carbon exudates to the microorganisms below—different cakes andcookies, as Elaine Ingham calls them—and ensure that diverse biology thrivesunderground. Planting them densely not only increases the amount of exudates, but alsoprotects the soil from erosion and carbon loss. And as much as possible, Streitmatter triesto combine plants as they occur in native plant communities. His thinking: It’s possiblethat these plants don’t grow near one another just by chance, but because they benefit one123another in some yet-unknown way, just as good neighbors do everywhere.Instead of applying herbicides, Streitmatter suggests hand pulling weeds and heavilymulching large weedy areas with “lasagna” compost—alternating a layer of brown or drystuff, like dead leaves and newspaper, with a layer of green stuff, like mown grass andplant trimmings—an easy way to discourage weeds, maintain soil moisture, and increasebiological activity. He warns against cutting grass lower than 2½ inches—Battery Parkgoes no lower than 3 inches—to protect the turf plants and discourage weeds. And there’sno need to plant our seeds or seedlings in spindly little rows separated by broad strips ofbare soil when designing a vegetable garden! Instead, Streitmatter encourages gardenersto sow vegetable seeds in masses—scatter them by the square foot, rather than the row—so that the growing plants cover the bare soil completely. I’ve done this in my new littleraised bed, just snipping away the tiny growing arugula and kale when I want to harvest. Ileave the roots there for my underground herd of microorganisms to polish off.Cucumbers are rooted around my tomato plants and seem to be growing happily in theirshade. I’ve never planted my vegetables so densely, but it seems to be working: I’mhaving a good harvest from this box of nutrient jungle.I’m trying to be a hero of the underground, in my own small way. We can all beheroes of the underground by taking care of the soil around us, patronizing theagriculturalists who take care of theirs, and monitoring the political climate that affectssoil health around the world. We have to pay attention to the farm bill! It’s the singlelargest manifestation of our nation’s food policy, and it has a huge impact on how ourfood is grown and how agriculture affects the greater environment, and on who benefitsfrom this enterprise. Will it be consumers and average farmers, or will it be agribusiness?It helps to heed the work of organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, Foodand Water Watch, the Environmental Working Group, and the National SustainableAgriculture Coalition, which can help us understand the issues behind the farm bill andother food policy measures. It’s too hard to understand this on our own. And with thatknowledge, we should take whatever action we can—calling our elected representatives,voting, protesting, whatever.Can we work with nature—and her so-called low technology, although humans havenothing that compares to its complexity and sophistication—to pull the carbon dioxidethat we’ve overloaded into the atmosphere and make good use of it in the ground? Can wereverse global warming in time to leave our children a good earth?So many smart people are working on this that I’m hopeful. Just as I was finishingthis last chapter, Peter Donovan e-mailed me a presentation made to the Sandia NationalLaboratories in New Mexico by the New Mexico State University (NMSU) Institute forSustainable Agricultural Research. As of this writing, it may represent the most excitingscience on this subject.The research began when NMSU molecular biologist David C. Johnson conducted an124experiment for the USDA to develop a process for making lower-salinity compost fromcow manure (apparently, cow poop is salty—maybe from all the salt licks?). Johnson andhis wife, Hui-Chun Su Johnson, did finally develop a compost with lower salinity,although he’s not exactly sure why it’s lower. His working assumption is that they madethe compost using a special “no-turn” method—most composts are turned when the pilegets too hot to prevent it from going anaerobic—and that left the fungi populationsundisturbed and able to flourish, while still admitting enough oxygen for the beneficialbacteria. He thinks it’s possible that the fungi tie up the salts and protect the plants.Johnson then tested the performance of this compost plus eight others on chile plantsin a greenhouse. The work really became interesting when he noticed that the chile plantsgrew with twice the vigor in his compost. When he teased out the various factors thataffected growth among these greenhouse plants, he found that none of the nutrients that aretypically considered essential to plant growth—in particular, nitrogen, phosphorus, andpotassium, which are the primary ingredients in conventional synthetic fertilizers andwhich were naturally present in all the composts—was the most important factor. Evensoil organic matter—the non-rock part of the soil that includes bulky plant and animalmaterial all the way down to highly concentrated humin—was not the primary factor.Instead, Johnson’s compost had a balanced population of healthy fungi and bacteria,compared with the predominantly bacterial population in the other composts, and it wasthis balance that made the chiles thrive. Typical soil tests, which look only at thechemistry in the soil and not the biology, will miss this.Intrigued, Johnson joined with NMSU entomologist John Ellington and engineer WesEaton to take this work into outside test plots, where they built up the soil biology—thistime by using cover crops. They didn’t clear the land for replanting; instead, new cropswere planted within the debris of the last season’s cover crops. At the end of 2 years, thesoil organic matter leapt by 67 percent and the soil’s water-holding capacity jumped bymore than 30 percent—a big deal in this arid climate. The best of these plots producedfour times as much green stuff as the world’s most productive ecosystems.“We showed that you can grow more crops faster, better, and with less water on soilswhere we’ve improved the population of microbes, both fungi and bacteria,” Johnson toldme. “The carbon sequestration is the icing on the cake.”The NMSU research suggests that the soil really can save us—and faster than anyoneexpected. In these plots made highly fertile by the interaction between plants and the soilbiology, the plants were generously shuttling 72 percent of the carbon they pulled from theair into the soil. Even more amazing, far more of this carbon was staying fixed in the soilcompared to land where the soil biology is weak and maltreated. While the researchersexpected the amount of CO2 wafting off the soil—the exhaled breath of the soil biology—to increase as the microorganisms themselves increased, the rate of respiration actuallydropped. Meaning, soil carbon storage was accelerating in a nonlinear fashion. Two plus125two was adding up to 15 or 20.To explain this, Johnson suggests thinking of the energy needed to build soil carbonas being like the energy needed to get an airplane off the ground. There is initially a heavyinvestment of energy to get the plane in the air. But once it’s up, the resistance is lowerand the thing flies. In the same way, once that population of soil microorganisms isestablished, there are greater efficiencies in both growing a crop and growing soilcarbon.Weirdly, we’ve all been schooled in the notion that plants are takers, removingnutrients from the soil and leaving it poorer. But when plants are allowed to work withtheir partners in the soil, they’re givers. They feed carbon exudates to the community ofbacteria and fungi to keep them thrumming with life and pulling mineral nutrients from thebedrock as well as from particles of sand, silt, and clay because they know—if that wordcan be applied to organisms without brains—that they will profit from the gift. When thepredator soil organisms eat the bacteria and fungi, all those nutrients are released near theplant. There’s always enough, unless humans or some other force messes up the system.One of the conclusions Johnson and the other NMSU researchers reached might makethe toes curl on climate activists around the world. In their report to Sandia—delivered inthe context of a project to see if the Mars Curiosity rover’s carbon-measuring equipmentcould be used for quick and accurate analyses of soil carbon on earth—they stated, “Therates of biomass production we are currently observing in this system have the capabilityto capture enough CO2 (50 tons CO2/acre) to offset all anthropogenic CO2 emissions onless than 11 percent of world cropland. Over twice this amount of land is fallow at anytime worldwide.” Meaning that if only 11 percent of the world’s cropland—land that istypically not in use—improved its community of soil microorganisms as much as Johnsonand his colleagues did in their test plots, the amount of carbon sequestered in the soilwould offset all our current emissions of carbon dioxide.It’s a rather staggering assertion.“Aren’t you afraid to say this?” I asked Johnson. “Aren’t you afraid saying that willlet the oil and gas companies off the hook? As well as the people burning down forestsand all the rest of us with a big fat carbon footprint? Aren’t you afraid?”I thought I could feel a wary shrug over the phone. “I don’t see anything on thehorizon that touches the effectiveness of this approach, plus it has so many other benefits,”he said. “We’re not going to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions anytime soon, becausewe depend too much on oil and gas, and the rest of the world wants our lifestyle. Thewhole idea is to get something that works right now, the world over, to make a significantimpact on reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide.”He added that we aren’t yet scientifically certain that removing CO2 from ouratmosphere will reverse the changes in our climate—we’ve never done it, and even the126best models can be wrong. Still, he says, it would be foolish not to try to do it by buildinghealthy soil, since this also improves plant productivity, allows us to use less water,reduces our use of dwindling natural resources like oil and phosphorus, and lowers theimpact of agriculture on the environment. Back to the question posed by so manyapologists for industrial agriculture, How do we feed 9 billion people? Answer: Let’sbegin by feeding our microbes.It appears to be in our power to reduce our legacy load of carbon dioxide, which hasa physical presence as well as psychic weight. It’s a question of national will andpriorities. We can only do it by working with plants and soil microorganisms, which havebeen carrying on the most wondrous dance since the early morning of time. We can’t keepbeing the oaf that breaks into the dance, bumping one partner or the other out of the way,thinking we can improve upon their step and sway. We suffer for this clumsiness. We needto stand back, pay close attention to the ways in which these partners need our help, andoffer it with the greatest of respect.
