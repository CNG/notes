I read this book on suggestion from Yizhen and with the goal of getting an overview of the state of biotechnology. The notes below are of varying thoroughness and are generally just a list of the people and projects I thought might be interesting to look up later. Mostly I did not write notes summarizing the content. This is just for me to have a place to go when I remember something I wanted to find later.

- gene therapy could offer fixes, such as shutting down extra chromosome that causes Down's syndrome by inserting the XIST gene that usually inactivates one of the X chromosomes in women

### Devil's ark
- humans have >200 cell types, so that many cancers
- International Cancer Genome Consortium collecting genomes of cancer cells
- Henrietta Lacks had cancer biopsied in 1951
    - cells were found to be immortal, family not told till 25 years later when researchers needed family DNA to create diagnostic markers since independently created cell lines were found to in fact be HeLa cells, apparently due to the cells' hardiness and ability to float on dust particles and travel on hands
    - HeLa cell cultures used in 60K+ papers, huge industry
    - Leigh Van Valen of University of Chicago wanted to give cells new species name, *Helacyton gartleri*, due to great genetic difference
    - Lars Steinmetz of European Molecular Biology Laboratory in 2013 published reference HeLa genome, full of extra chromosome copies and errors, with 2000 genes expressed higher than normal
        - published without formal consent from family, though none was actually required; retracted paper
    - Rebecca Skloot (author of book on Lacks): "the view we have today of genomes is like a world map, but Google Street View is coming very soon"

- Sir John Gurdon in 2012 got Nobel prize for turning adult cell back to pluripotent stem cell
- Spanish bucardo went extinct in '90s and was resurrected, but had three lungs and other problems and died after 10 minutes
- polio virus recreated in 2002, 1918 flu in 2005, but viruses don't have a development process to get bungled

### Synthia

### Embryo genomics
- higher error rate as parents, particularly mothers, age, and in IVF
- Connor Levy selected and born 2013 after Dagan Wells at Oxford checked 14 embryos for genetics issues
- Wells thinks designer babies via IVF selection remote risk since a dozen embryos wouldn't likely have the combination of traits desired
- alternatively, select better partner in first place, screen for diseases, etc.: Lee Silverman started GenePeeks to help women choose partners
- 23andMe patent "Gamete donor selection based on genetic calculations"

    - work demonstrated "shotgun sequencing": instead of crawling in sequence, break genome to many parts and reassemble later
- Owen White led creation of first visual genome map

### Genomic GOLD
- Venter sequenced *Methanococcus jannaschii*, demonstrating Carl Woese was right about third domain, Archaea, being fundamentally different genetically than Bacteria and Eukaryotes
- Nikos Kyrpides of Energy Department's Joint Genome Institute started spreadsheet that turned into Genomes Online Database (GOLD)
- second vertebrate sequenced was Fugu, tropical fish with little noncoding DNA, so genome was easier to sequence

### Does size matter?
- viruses typically 10Kbp, smallest 300bp
- genus *Pandoraviruses*  at 1x0.5um almost size of bacteria and 1.9 to 2.5Mbp, only 7 percent of which matches known genes
- bacteria genomes up to 10Mbp, archaea up to 5Mbp
- endosymbiotic bacteria have smaller genomes
    - mitochondria have 37 genes
    - *Mycobacterium leprae* have 1600 genes, half of which are off and on the way out, while close relative *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* has 4000
    - *Candidatus Nasuia deltocephalinicola* has 112Kbp and 137 genes
- animal genomes range in size by factor of 3300, land plants by 1000, protists by 300,000

    - *Amborella trichopoda* (primitive shrub) is sole sister of all living flowering plants (angiosperms); polyploidy event 160MYA
    - Norway spruce, *Picea abies*, first gymnosperm to be sequenced; 20Gbp due to repetitive DNA
    - Barbara McClintock in 1948 discovered transposable elements

### Don't call it junk
- humans have about 20K genes, just more than *C. elegans*'s 18K
- C value paradox: complexity explained by ncDNA percentage, but strange because ncDNA thought to be result of repetitive and potentially harmful elements
- exons (protein coding) are 3 percent of human genome
- Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project discovered much ncDNA is transcribed as RNA, and not all RNA is mRNA
    - first this non mRNA RNA thought to be "background noise", but discovered it was different in different cells
- now believed ncDNA coding for RNA could mean humans have 160K genes, in a sense

### The first tweenome
- genome of 5Mbp could differ by 20% between individuals; "pan-genome" or gene pool is all possibilities for a species
- Jennifer Grady of British Columbia Center for Disease Control predicts era of continuously sequencing sewage, etc.

        - http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2011/08/03/notes-from-an-e-coli-tweenome-lessons-learned-from-our-first-data-doi/

### Denisovan girl
- 99 percent of estimated 4 billion species ever are now extinct
- reconstructing ancient migration patterns, species makeup of Pleistocene ecosystems
- Svante Paabo of Max Planck Institute in 2012 led sequencing of 80K year old sample thought to be Neanderthal, but was actually Denisovan, related species
    - sequence was similar quality to fresh sample; genomics used for first time to date a fossil
- Eske Willerslev of University of Copenhagen in 2013 sequenced Thistle Creek horse fossil from 700K years ago
    - only two percent of DNA was endogenous
- Morton Allentoft in 2012 found DNA half life is 521 years, based on studying bones ranging 500 to 6000 years old
    - somehow this means unlikely to get usable DNA from samples more than 1.5M years old, and best case in frozen tundra might be 6.8M, so likely won't get dinosaur DNA?

### Single-celled sisters
- last universal common ancestor (LUCA) likely contains "minimum information for a living organism" (MILO)
- closest single celled sister is *Monosiga brevicollis*, with 9200 proteins
    - we share common unicellular ancestor 600MYA

### Microbial Earth
- Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project (GEBA) first to aim to systematically explore natural genomic diversity
    - previous projects selected species for special role, but now want to increase sheer diversity
    - focus on "type strains", domesticated bacteria that can be grown in culture, about 11K types

- marine invertebrates studied by Global Invertebrate Genomics Alliance (GIGA) project
- Jonathon Coddington of Smithsonian leading Global Genome Initiative, aiming to sequence 80 to 100K genomes
    - starting by collecting sample and freezing, waiting for sequencing costs to drop

## 5. No organism is an island

- others showed microbiome might be related to climate
- Bergmann's rule in ecology: body size increases at higher latitudes
- Taichi Suzuki and Michael Worobey reported proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes and also body mass higher away from tropics

### Eating for trillions
- mother's milk contains sugars baby can't digest but took energy to make; found they are for *Bifidobacterium infantis*, which dominates guts of newborns, crowding out harmful bacteria in the new gut
- US Office of Naval Research and Rice University's Jeff Tabor hope to engineer bacteria to turn on genes depending on detected conditions, providing cure to problems found

### Microbes on the brink
- Barry Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 identified*Helicobacter pylori* causes stomach ulcers before anyone knew bacteria could survive in stomach
- Martin Blaser at New York University points out 80 percent of people infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic and it might play a positive role, perhaps in regulating metabolism and immune system
- the species was once present in almost everyone, but now half, due to sanitation, etc., improvements
 
### Genomic donations
- fecal transplants known in Chinese medicine and horse breeding for thousands of years, recently getting attention
- FDA moved in 2013 to regular human feces as a drug, but suspended pending review
- Eric Alm of MIT in 2014 suggested regulating as a tissue like blood

### 2 per cent of pandas
- plant root bacterial coating is rhizosphere
- giant pandas (2500 remain) have 19,000 genes, 2.4Gbp genome
    - may not express gene for umami taste common in meats, leading to vegetarianism
    - still express enzymes for digesting meat, but don't have enzymes for digesting bamboo
- 34 individuals (2% population) sequenced, revealing population expansion following switch to bamboo 3MYA
- panda microbiome could help develop ways to break down plant waste to create fuels
    
### The last prairie
- "The relatively gentle tilling of soil might have a similar impact on soil microbes as clear-cutting a forest does on larger species."
- Noah Fierer of University of Colorado collected 31 pairs of tilled and untilled samples from prairies
    - developed better ways to detect bacterial DNA in soils
    - soils differed in abundance of Verrucomicrobia bacteria, which was detected in 180 of 181 soil samples from across the world
        - abundance of Verrucomicrobia estimated at 23 percent of soil microbes on average, more than 50% in grasslands
        - only a few species of the bacteria are known, and they are not well characterized because they are hard to grow in the lab
        - thrive in nutrient poor soils and might be outcompeted in fertilized soils

## 6. Terra-genoming

### The lingering kiss
- all cells have genomes with few exceptions: red blood cells ditch nucleus at maturity to allow concave shape, gametes have haploid 
- DNA tags could be used instead of ink for security tracing, etc.

### Invaders
- genetic monitoring as an early warning system, such as for Asian carp
- genetic modification to displace disease carrying mosquitos
- prevent Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) from breeding in Calif. by
    - dropping sterilized males to make it unlikely females will be able to reproduce
    - males created by genetically modifying such that factory temperature can be raised to only kill females
    - then males made sterile by radioactivity usually
    - detect female mated with a modified female because sperm glow in UV

### Genes on the move
- Jan-Hendrick Hehemann in 2010 showed digestion microbes also incorporate random DNA from food into their genomes
- carbohydrate active enzymes, CAZymes, produced by gut bacteria
- *Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron* has 261 CAZyme genes, prevalent in obese people

    - harmed bacterial diversity downstream
    - bugs had antibiotic resistance genes, and while many of those don't infect humans, could pass to others in crops 
    - wild type often outgrow resistant strains thankfully

### A dead sea comes to life
- Dutch inventor Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 created first microscope and discovered Protists in 1674, Bacteria in 1676 and spermatozoa in 1677
- Carl Woese and colleagues including Norman Pace created methods of pulling 16S ribosomal genes ("DNA name" of Bacteria and Archaea) from environment
- polymerase came from Yellowstone Park thermophile *Thermus aquaticus*
-  Jo Handelsman in 1998 coined "metagenomics" as growing DNA chopped from environment in lab bacteria for screening for interesting traits
-  Craig Venter in 2005 launched Global Ocean Survey studying water from Sargasso Sea, sea without shores in Atlantic as large as U.S. and famous for floating seaweed, *Sargassum*
    -  oligotrophic (nutrient poor) because no runoffs from land, surrounded by ocean currents, giving deep blue color and clarity
    - low diversity made good candidate for testing shotgun sequencing, but actually found much life
    - found 1800 species of microbes (150 new) and 1.2M genes
    - next circumnavigated globe, stopped every 200km: first 41 stops produced 17M new genes
- expanded by International Census of Marine Microbes led by Mitch Sogin and Linda Amaral-Zettler of Woods Hole and Jan de Leeuw of Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research
- Earth Microbiome Project led by Jack Gilbert, Rob Knight and Janet Janssen cataloged 9M types of bacteria

### Shock and awe
- "Big Five" extinctions were Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Triassic and Cretaceous
- perhaps in 300 years we will have lost more than 75%, qualifying as Anthropocene mass extinction

    - aims to understand whole hospital ecosystem over time, not just a few pathogens

### A buoy in the ocean
- Gilbert's research at Station L4 off Plymouth coast led to understanding microbiome of ocean changes with day length; longer nights meant more diversity
- later found species basically all stay all year, but proportions change; remarkable: entire study accounted for only 4 percent of what was found in one deep analysis of one month's sample
- compared to International Census of Marine Microbes, seems might hold true everywhere

### Cottonwood, cod, and corals
- Tom Whitham: "community genomics", genes can affect multiple species in ecosystem and homeostasis
- Richard Dawkins in 19080s argued genes can have phenotype extending beyond organism they are part of
- comparison of richest 1 percent phenomenon to what is happening with humanity's effect on biodiversity
- Cod had 10x number of genes typical in major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) region and no genes in MHC II, might be tied to cod survival
- ocean acidification due to CO2 absorption might lead to animals not being able to form their hard shells

### The Moorea Biocode
- David Liittschwager and "biocube": sampled species passing through at various locations, usually found 100-400 visible species
- Moorea island became hot spot for studying biodiversity, cataloged many thousands of species; goal to create computational model of the island, Moorea Avatar Project

- "biocode": two or more interacting genomes
- "grand unification underway", genomic synthesis in many areas: genomics, microbiomics, metagenomics, DNA barcoding… personal, synthetic, evolutionary, ecological, environmental and sustainability genomics

### Our place in nature
- Theodosius Dobzhansky's "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"
    - Periodic Table explains only so much about substances just as genomics explains only so much about living systems; "emergent" phenomena
- tree of life that started 3.5BYA (of which we are on a twig started 200KYA) could be viewed as web given horizontal gene transfer, esp b/w microbes

### Sunjammer
- business interest in genes
    - IBM in 2014 hosted conference Sequence the City: Metagenomics in the Era of Big Data

### The Planetary Genome Project
- first global "Big Science" project, 05 June 1769, to improve estimation of distance from Earth to Sun (length of Astronomical Unit) by observing Transit of Venus
    - this was mentioned in a hilarious story in Bill Bryson's "A Short History of Nearly Everything": from http://everything2.com/user/Semisane/writeups/A+Short+History+of+Nearly+Everything, which i found confirming my suspicion this was mentioned: "The fourth chapter of Bryson's engaging book, in particular, documents the travails of scientists like Guillaume Le Gentil, who set out to observe the transit of Venus in 1761 but found himself uselessly aboard a pitching ship at the time. He then prepared an elaborate viewing platform for the 1769 transit (they always come in pairs of two, eight years apart and often with centuries in between pairs) only to have that part of the sky misfortunately obscured by a cloud for the precise duration of the astronomical event. In a set of circumstances Bilbo Baggins would commiserate with, he then returned home to find that his relatives had pronounced him dead and plundered his estate."
- Oceean Sampling Day, first coordinated action of Genomic Observatories Network, modeled on L4 buoy work
- "spidering out of science, combining core central facilities, like museums and genomics laboratories–usually found in cities–with a global network of field stations–some very remote–is the vision of future studies of the planetary genome."
- understanding software of our planet is a goal in sight now, as understanding Earth to Sun distance was in 1700s
- "Barely five decades from the elucidation of the structure of DNA, and just one decade since sequencing the human genome, we are embarking on biocoding the planet." (bring on the singularity)
